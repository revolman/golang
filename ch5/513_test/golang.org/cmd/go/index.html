<h3 id="hdr-Start_a_bug_report">Start a bug report</h3>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>go bug
</pre>
<p>
Bug opens the default browser and starts a new bug report.
The report includes useful system information.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Compile_packages_and_dependencies">Compile packages and dependencies</h3>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>go build [-o output] [-i] [build flags] [packages]
</pre>
<p>
Build compiles the packages named by the import paths,
along with their dependencies, but it does not install the results.
</p>
<p>
If the arguments to build are a list of .go files from a single directory,
build treats them as a list of source files specifying a single package.
</p>
<p>
When compiling packages, build ignores files that end in &#39;_test.go&#39;.
</p>
<p>
When compiling a single main package, build writes
the resulting executable to an output file named after
the first source file (&#39;go build ed.go rx.go&#39; writes &#39;ed&#39; or &#39;ed.exe&#39;)
or the source code directory (&#39;go build unix/sam&#39; writes &#39;sam&#39; or &#39;sam.exe&#39;).
The &#39;.exe&#39; suffix is added when writing a Windows executable.
</p>
<p>
When compiling multiple packages or a single non-main package,
build compiles the packages but discards the resulting object,
serving only as a check that the packages can be built.
</p>
<p>
The -o flag forces build to write the resulting executable or object
to the named output file or directory, instead of the default behavior described
in the last two paragraphs. If the named output is a directory that exists,
then any resulting executables will be written to that directory.
</p>
<p>
The -i flag installs the packages that are dependencies of the target.
</p>
<p>
The build flags are shared by the build, clean, get, install, list, run,
and test commands:
</p>
<pre>-a
	force rebuilding of packages that are already up-to-date.
-n
	print the commands but do not run them.
-p n
	the number of programs, such as build commands or
	test binaries, that can be run in parallel.
	The default is the number of CPUs available.
-race
	enable data race detection.
	Supported only on linux/amd64, freebsd/amd64, darwin/amd64, windows/amd64,
	linux/ppc64le and linux/arm64 (only for 48-bit VMA).
-msan
	enable interoperation with memory sanitizer.
	Supported only on linux/amd64, linux/arm64
	and only with Clang/LLVM as the host C compiler.
	On linux/arm64, pie build mode will be used.
-v
	print the names of packages as they are compiled.
-work
	print the name of the temporary work directory and
	do not delete it when exiting.
-x
	print the commands.

-asmflags &#39;[pattern=]arg list&#39;
	arguments to pass on each go tool asm invocation.
-buildmode mode
	build mode to use. See &#39;go help buildmode&#39; for more.
-compiler name
	name of compiler to use, as in runtime.Compiler (gccgo or gc).
-gccgoflags &#39;[pattern=]arg list&#39;
	arguments to pass on each gccgo compiler/linker invocation.
-gcflags &#39;[pattern=]arg list&#39;
	arguments to pass on each go tool compile invocation.
-installsuffix suffix
	a suffix to use in the name of the package installation directory,
	in order to keep output separate from default builds.
	If using the -race flag, the install suffix is automatically set to race
	or, if set explicitly, has _race appended to it. Likewise for the -msan
	flag. Using a -buildmode option that requires non-default compile flags
	has a similar effect.
-ldflags &#39;[pattern=]arg list&#39;
	arguments to pass on each go tool link invocation.
-linkshared
	build code that will be linked against shared libraries previously
	created with -buildmode=shared.
-mod mode
	module download mode to use: readonly, vendor, or mod.
	See &#39;go help modules&#39; for more.
-modcacherw
	leave newly-created directories in the module cache read-write
	instead of making them read-only.
-modfile file
	in module aware mode, read (and possibly write) an alternate go.mod
	file instead of the one in the module root directory. A file named
	&#34;go.mod&#34; must still be present in order to determine the module root
	directory, but it is not accessed. When -modfile is specified, an
	alternate go.sum file is also used: its path is derived from the
	-modfile flag by trimming the &#34;.mod&#34; extension and appending &#34;.sum&#34;.
-pkgdir dir
	install and load all packages from dir instead of the usual locations.
	For example, when building with a non-standard configuration,
	use -pkgdir to keep generated packages in a separate location.
-tags tag,list
	a comma-separated list of build tags to consider satisfied during the
	build. For more information about build tags, see the description of
	build constraints in the documentation for the go/build package.
	(Earlier versions of Go used a space-separated list, and that form
	is deprecated but still recognized.)
-trimpath
	remove all file system paths from the resulting executable.
	Instead of absolute file system paths, the recorded file names
	will begin with either &#34;go&#34; (for the standard library),
	or a module path@version (when using modules),
	or a plain import path (when using GOPATH).
-toolexec &#39;cmd args&#39;
	a program to use to invoke toolchain programs like vet and asm.
	For example, instead of running asm, the go command will run
	&#39;cmd args /path/to/asm &lt;arguments for asm&gt;&#39;.
</pre>
<p>
The -asmflags, -gccgoflags, -gcflags, and -ldflags flags accept a
space-separated list of arguments to pass to an underlying tool
during the build. To embed spaces in an element in the list, surround
it with either single or double quotes. The argument list may be
preceded by a package pattern and an equal sign, which restricts
the use of that argument list to the building of packages matching
that pattern (see &#39;go help packages&#39; for a description of package
patterns). Without a pattern, the argument list applies only to the
packages named on the command line. The flags may be repeated
with different patterns in order to specify different arguments for
different sets of packages. If a package matches patterns given in
multiple flags, the latest match on the command line wins.
For example, &#39;go build -gcflags=-S fmt&#39; prints the disassembly
only for package fmt, while &#39;go build -gcflags=all=-S fmt&#39;
prints the disassembly for fmt and all its dependencies.
</p>
<p>
For more about specifying packages, see &#39;go help packages&#39;.
For more about where packages and binaries are installed,
run &#39;go help gopath&#39;.
For more about calling between Go and C/C++, run &#39;go help c&#39;.
</p>
<p>
Note: Build adheres to certain conventions such as those described
by &#39;go help gopath&#39;. Not all projects can follow these conventions,
however. Installations that have their own conventions or that use
a separate software build system may choose to use lower-level
invocations such as &#39;go tool compile&#39; and &#39;go tool link&#39; to avoid
some of the overheads and design decisions of the build tool.

<h3 id="hdr-Remove_object_files_and_cached_files">Remove object files and cached files</h3>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>go clean [clean flags] [build flags] [packages]
</pre>
<p>
Clean removes object files from package source directories.
The go command builds most objects in a temporary directory,
so go clean is mainly concerned with object files left by other
tools or by manual invocations of go build.
</p>
<p>
If a package argument is given or the -i or -r flag is set,
clean removes the following files from each of the
source directories corresponding to the import paths:
</p>
<pre>_obj/            old object directory, left from Makefiles
_test/           old test directory, left from Makefiles
_testmain.go     old gotest file, left from Makefiles
test.out         old test log, left from Makefiles
build.out        old test log, left from Makefiles
*.[568ao]        object files, left from Makefiles

DIR(.exe)        from go build
DIR.test(.exe)   from go test -c
MAINFILE(.exe)   from go build MAINFILE.go
*.so             from SWIG
</pre>
<p>
In the list, DIR represents the final path element of the
directory, and MAINFILE is the base name of any Go source
file in the directory that is not included when building
the package.
</p>
<p>
The -i flag causes clean to remove the corresponding installed
archive or binary (what &#39;go install&#39; would create).
</p>
<p>
The -n flag causes clean to print the remove commands it would execute,
but not run them.
</p>
<p>
The -r flag causes clean to be applied recursively to all the
dependencies of the packages named by the import paths.
</p>
<p>
The -x flag causes clean to print remove commands as it executes them.
</p>
<p>
The -cache flag causes clean to remove the entire go build cache.
</p>
<p>
The -testcache flag causes clean to expire all test results in the
go build cache.
</p>
<p>
The -modcache flag causes clean to remove the entire module
download cache, including unpacked source code of versioned
dependencies.
</p>
<p>
For more about build flags, see &#39;go help build&#39;.
</p>
<p>
For more about specifying packages, see &#39;go help packages&#39;.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Show_documentation_for_package_or_symbol">Show documentation for package or symbol</h3>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>go doc [-u] [-c] [package|[package.]symbol[.methodOrField]]
</pre>
<p>
Doc prints the documentation comments associated with the item identified by its
arguments (a package, const, func, type, var, method, or struct field)
followed by a one-line summary of each of the first-level items &#34;under&#34;
that item (package-level declarations for a package, methods for a type,
etc.).
</p>
<p>
Doc accepts zero, one, or two arguments.
</p>
<p>
Given no arguments, that is, when run as
</p>
<pre>go doc
</pre>
<p>
it prints the package documentation for the package in the current directory.
If the package is a command (package main), the exported symbols of the package
are elided from the presentation unless the -cmd flag is provided.
</p>
<p>
When run with one argument, the argument is treated as a Go-syntax-like
representation of the item to be documented. What the argument selects depends
on what is installed in GOROOT and GOPATH, as well as the form of the argument,
which is schematically one of these:
</p>
<pre>go doc &lt;pkg&gt;
go doc &lt;sym&gt;[.&lt;methodOrField&gt;]
go doc [&lt;pkg&gt;.]&lt;sym&gt;[.&lt;methodOrField&gt;]
go doc [&lt;pkg&gt;.][&lt;sym&gt;.]&lt;methodOrField&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The first item in this list matched by the argument is the one whose documentation
is printed. (See the examples below.) However, if the argument starts with a capital
letter it is assumed to identify a symbol or method in the current directory.
</p>
<p>
For packages, the order of scanning is determined lexically in breadth-first order.
That is, the package presented is the one that matches the search and is nearest
the root and lexically first at its level of the hierarchy. The GOROOT tree is
always scanned in its entirety before GOPATH.
</p>
<p>
If there is no package specified or matched, the package in the current
directory is selected, so &#34;go doc Foo&#34; shows the documentation for symbol Foo in
the current package.
</p>
<p>
The package path must be either a qualified path or a proper suffix of a
path. The go tool&#39;s usual package mechanism does not apply: package path
elements like . and ... are not implemented by go doc.
</p>
<p>
When run with two arguments, the first must be a full package path (not just a
suffix), and the second is a symbol, or symbol with method or struct field.
This is similar to the syntax accepted by godoc:
</p>
<pre>go doc &lt;pkg&gt; &lt;sym&gt;[.&lt;methodOrField&gt;]
</pre>
<p>
In all forms, when matching symbols, lower-case letters in the argument match
either case but upper-case letters match exactly. This means that there may be
multiple matches of a lower-case argument in a package if different symbols have
different cases. If this occurs, documentation for all matches is printed.
</p>
<p>
Examples:
</p>
<pre>go doc
	Show documentation for current package.
go doc Foo
	Show documentation for Foo in the current package.
	(Foo starts with a capital letter so it cannot match
	a package path.)
go doc encoding/json
	Show documentation for the encoding/json package.
go doc json
	Shorthand for encoding/json.
go doc json.Number (or go doc json.number)
	Show documentation and method summary for json.Number.
go doc json.Number.Int64 (or go doc json.number.int64)
	Show documentation for json.Number&#39;s Int64 method.
go doc cmd/doc
	Show package docs for the doc command.
go doc -cmd cmd/doc
	Show package docs and exported symbols within the doc command.
go doc template.new
	Show documentation for html/template&#39;s New function.
	(html/template is lexically before text/template)
go doc text/template.new # One argument
	Show documentation for text/template&#39;s New function.
go doc text/template new # Two arguments
	Show documentation for text/template&#39;s New function.

At least in the current tree, these invocations all print the
documentation for json.Decoder&#39;s Decode method:

go doc json.Decoder.Decode
go doc json.decoder.decode
go doc json.decode
cd go/src/encoding/json; go doc decode
</pre>
<p>
Flags:
</p>
<pre>-all
	Show all the documentation for the package.
-c
	Respect case when matching symbols.
-cmd
	Treat a command (package main) like a regular package.
	Otherwise package main&#39;s exported symbols are hidden
	when showing the package&#39;s top-level documentation.
-short
	One-line representation for each symbol.
-src
	Show the full source code for the symbol. This will
	display the full Go source of its declaration and
	definition, such as a function definition (including
	the body), type declaration or enclosing const
	block. The output may therefore include unexported
	details.
-u
	Show documentation for unexported as well as exported
	symbols, methods, and fields.
</pre>
<h3 id="hdr-Print_Go_environment_information">Print Go environment information</h3>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>go env [-json] [-u] [-w] [var ...]
</pre>
<p>
Env prints Go environment information.
</p>
<p>
By default env prints information as a shell script
(on Windows, a batch file). If one or more variable
names is given as arguments, env prints the value of
each named variable on its own line.
</p>
<p>
The -json flag prints the environment in JSON format
instead of as a shell script.
</p>
<p>
The -u flag requires one or more arguments and unsets
the default setting for the named environment variables,
if one has been set with &#39;go env -w&#39;.
</p>
<p>
The -w flag requires one or more arguments of the
form NAME=VALUE and changes the default settings
of the named environment variables to the given values.
</p>
<p>
For more about environment variables, see &#39;go help environment&#39;.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Update_packages_to_use_new_APIs">Update packages to use new APIs</h3>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>go fix [packages]
</pre>
<p>
Fix runs the Go fix command on the packages named by the import paths.
</p>
<p>
For more about fix, see &#39;go doc cmd/fix&#39;.
For more about specifying packages, see &#39;go help packages&#39;.
</p>
<p>
To run fix with specific options, run &#39;go tool fix&#39;.
</p>
<p>
See also: go fmt, go vet.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Gofmt__reformat__package_sources">Gofmt (reformat) package sources</h3>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>go fmt [-n] [-x] [packages]
</pre>
<p>
Fmt runs the command &#39;gofmt -l -w&#39; on the packages named
by the import paths. It prints the names of the files that are modified.
</p>
<p>
For more about gofmt, see &#39;go doc cmd/gofmt&#39;.
For more about specifying packages, see &#39;go help packages&#39;.
</p>
<p>
The -n flag prints commands that would be executed.
The -x flag prints commands as they are executed.
</p>
<p>
The -mod flag&#39;s value sets which module download mode
to use: readonly or vendor. See &#39;go help modules&#39; for more.
</p>
<p>
To run gofmt with specific options, run gofmt itself.
</p>
<p>
See also: go fix, go vet.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Generate_Go_files_by_processing_source">Generate Go files by processing source</h3>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>go generate [-run regexp] [-n] [-v] [-x] [build flags] [file.go... | packages]
</pre>
<p>
Generate runs commands described by directives within existing
files. Those commands can run any process but the intent is to
create or update Go source files.
</p>
<p>
Go generate is never run automatically by go build, go get, go test,
and so on. It must be run explicitly.
</p>
<p>
Go generate scans the file for directives, which are lines of
the form,
</p>
<pre>//go:generate command argument...
</pre>
<p>
(note: no leading spaces and no space in &#34;//go&#34;) where command
is the generator to be run, corresponding to an executable file
that can be run locally. It must either be in the shell path
(gofmt), a fully qualified path (/usr/you/bin/mytool), or a
command alias, described below.
</p>
<p>
To convey to humans and machine tools that code is generated,
generated source should have a line that matches the following
regular expression (in Go syntax):
</p>
<pre>^// Code generated .* DO NOT EDIT\.$
</pre>
<p>
The line may appear anywhere in the file, but is typically
placed near the beginning so it is easy to find.
</p>
<p>
Note that go generate does not parse the file, so lines that look
like directives in comments or multiline strings will be treated
as directives.
</p>
<p>
The arguments to the directive are space-separated tokens or
double-quoted strings passed to the generator as individual
arguments when it is run.
</p>
<p>
Quoted strings use Go syntax and are evaluated before execution; a
quoted string appears as a single argument to the generator.
</p>
<p>
Go generate sets several variables when it runs the generator:
</p>
<pre>$GOARCH
	The execution architecture (arm, amd64, etc.)
$GOOS
	The execution operating system (linux, windows, etc.)
$GOFILE
	The base name of the file.
$GOLINE
	The line number of the directive in the source file.
$GOPACKAGE
	The name of the package of the file containing the directive.
$DOLLAR
	A dollar sign.
</pre>
<p>
Other than variable substitution and quoted-string evaluation, no
special processing such as &#34;globbing&#34; is performed on the command
line.
</p>
<p>
As a last step before running the command, any invocations of any
environment variables with alphanumeric names, such as $GOFILE or
$HOME, are expanded throughout the command line. The syntax for
variable expansion is $NAME on all operating systems. Due to the
order of evaluation, variables are expanded even inside quoted
strings. If the variable NAME is not set, $NAME expands to the
empty string.
</p>
<p>
A directive of the form,
</p>
<pre>//go:generate -command xxx args...
</pre>
<p>
specifies, for the remainder of this source file only, that the
string xxx represents the command identified by the arguments. This
can be used to create aliases or to handle multiword generators.
For example,
</p>
<pre>//go:generate -command foo go tool foo
</pre>
<p>
specifies that the command &#34;foo&#34; represents the generator
&#34;go tool foo&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Generate processes packages in the order given on the command line,
one at a time. If the command line lists .go files from a single directory,
they are treated as a single package. Within a package, generate processes the
source files in a package in file name order, one at a time. Within
a source file, generate runs generators in the order they appear
in the file, one at a time. The go generate tool also sets the build
tag &#34;generate&#34; so that files may be examined by go generate but ignored
during build.
</p>
<p>
If any generator returns an error exit status, &#34;go generate&#34; skips
all further processing for that package.
</p>
<p>
The generator is run in the package&#39;s source directory.
</p>
<p>
Go generate accepts one specific flag:
</p>
<pre>-run=&#34;&#34;
	if non-empty, specifies a regular expression to select
	directives whose full original source text (excluding
	any trailing spaces and final newline) matches the
	expression.
</pre>
<p>
It also accepts the standard build flags including -v, -n, and -x.
The -v flag prints the names of packages and files as they are
processed.
The -n flag prints commands that would be executed.
The -x flag prints commands as they are executed.
</p>

<h3 id="hdr-Add_dependencies_to_current_module_and_install_them">Add dependencies to current module and install them</h3>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>go get [-d] [-t] [-u] [-v] [-insecure] [build flags] [packages]
</pre>
<p>
Get resolves and adds dependencies to the current development module
and then builds and installs them.
</p>
<p>
The first step is to resolve which dependencies to add.
</p>
<p>
For each named package or package pattern, get must decide which version of
the corresponding module to use. By default, get looks up the latest tagged
release version, such as v0.4.5 or v1.2.3. If there are no tagged release
versions, get looks up the latest tagged pre-release version, such as
v0.0.1-pre1. If there are no tagged versions at all, get looks up the latest
known commit. If the module is not already required at a later version
(for example, a pre-release newer than the latest release), get will use
the version it looked up. Otherwise, get will use the currently
required version.
</p>
<p>
This default version selection can be overridden by adding an @version
suffix to the package argument, as in &#39;go get golang.org/x/text@v0.3.0&#39;.
The version may be a prefix: @v1 denotes the latest available version starting
with v1. See &#39;go help modules&#39; under the heading &#39;Module queries&#39; for the
full query syntax.
</p>
<p>
For modules stored in source control repositories, the version suffix can
also be a commit hash, branch identifier, or other syntax known to the
source control system, as in &#39;go get golang.org/x/text@master&#39;. Note that
branches with names that overlap with other module query syntax cannot be
selected explicitly. For example, the suffix @v2 means the latest version
starting with v2, not the branch named v2.
</p>
<p>
If a module under consideration is already a dependency of the current
development module, then get will update the required version.
Specifying a version earlier than the current required version is valid and
downgrades the dependency. The version suffix @none indicates that the
dependency should be removed entirely, downgrading or removing modules
depending on it as needed.
</p>
<p>
The version suffix @latest explicitly requests the latest minor release of the
module named by the given path. The suffix @upgrade is like @latest but
will not downgrade a module if it is already required at a revision or
pre-release version newer than the latest released version. The suffix
@patch requests the latest patch release: the latest released version
with the same major and minor version numbers as the currently required
version. Like @upgrade, @patch will not downgrade a module already required
at a newer version. If the path is not already required, @upgrade and @patch
are equivalent to @latest.
</p>
<p>
Although get defaults to using the latest version of the module containing
a named package, it does not use the latest version of that module&#39;s
dependencies. Instead it prefers to use the specific dependency versions
requested by that module. For example, if the latest A requires module
B v1.2.3, while B v1.2.4 and v1.3.1 are also available, then &#39;go get A&#39;
will use the latest A but then use B v1.2.3, as requested by A. (If there
are competing requirements for a particular module, then &#39;go get&#39; resolves
those requirements by taking the maximum requested version.)
</p>
<p>
The -t flag instructs get to consider modules needed to build tests of
packages specified on the command line.
</p>
<p>
The -u flag instructs get to update modules providing dependencies
of packages named on the command line to use newer minor or patch
releases when available. Continuing the previous example, &#39;go get -u A&#39;
will use the latest A with B v1.3.1 (not B v1.2.3). If B requires module C,
but C does not provide any packages needed to build packages in A
(not including tests), then C will not be updated.
</p>
<p>
The -u=patch flag (not -u patch) also instructs get to update dependencies,
but changes the default to select patch releases.
Continuing the previous example,
&#39;go get -u=patch A@latest&#39; will use the latest A with B v1.2.4 (not B v1.2.3),
while &#39;go get -u=patch A&#39; will use a patch release of A instead.
</p>
<p>
When the -t and -u flags are used together, get will update
test dependencies as well.
</p>
<p>
In general, adding a new dependency may require upgrading
existing dependencies to keep a working build, and &#39;go get&#39; does
this automatically. Similarly, downgrading one dependency may
require downgrading other dependencies, and &#39;go get&#39; does
this automatically as well.
</p>
<p>
The -insecure flag permits fetching from repositories and resolving
custom domains using insecure schemes such as HTTP. Use with caution.
</p>
<p>
The second step is to download (if needed), build, and install
the named packages.
</p>
<p>
If an argument names a module but not a package (because there is no
Go source code in the module&#39;s root directory), then the install step
is skipped for that argument, instead of causing a build failure.
For example &#39;go get golang.org/x/perf&#39; succeeds even though there
is no code corresponding to that import path.
</p>
<p>
Note that package patterns are allowed and are expanded after resolving
the module versions. For example, &#39;go get golang.org/x/perf/cmd/...&#39;
adds the latest golang.org/x/perf and then installs the commands in that
latest version.
</p>
<p>
The -d flag instructs get to download the source code needed to build
the named packages, including downloading necessary dependencies,
but not to build and install them.
</p>
<p>
With no package arguments, &#39;go get&#39; applies to Go package in the
current directory, if any. In particular, &#39;go get -u&#39; and
&#39;go get -u=patch&#39; update all the dependencies of that package.
With no package arguments and also without -u, &#39;go get&#39; is not much more
than &#39;go install&#39;, and &#39;go get -d&#39; not much more than &#39;go list&#39;.

This text describes the behavior of get using modules to manage source
code and dependencies. If instead the go command is running in GOPATH
mode, the details of get&#39;s flags and effects change, as does &#39;go help get&#39;.

<h3 id="hdr-Compile_and_install_packages_and_dependencies">Compile and install packages and dependencies</h3>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>go install [-i] [build flags] [packages]
</pre>
<p>
Install compiles and installs the packages named by the import paths.
</p>
<p>
Executables are installed in the directory named by the GOBIN environment
variable, which defaults to $GOPATH/bin or $HOME/go/bin if the GOPATH
environment variable is not set. Executables in $GOROOT
are installed in $GOROOT/bin or $GOTOOLDIR instead of $GOBIN.
</p>
<p>
When module-aware mode is disabled, other packages are installed in the
directory $GOPATH/pkg/$GOOS_$GOARCH. When module-aware mode is enabled,
other packages are built and cached but not installed.
</p>
<p>
The -i flag installs the dependencies of the named packages as well.
</p>

</p>
<h3 id="hdr-List_packages_or_modules">List packages or modules</h3>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>go list [-f format] [-json] [-m] [list flags] [build flags] [packages]
</pre>
<p>
List lists the named packages, one per line.
The most commonly-used flags are -f and -json, which control the form
of the output printed for each package. Other list flags, documented below,
control more specific details.
</p>
<p>
The default output shows the package import path:
</p>
<pre>bytes
encoding/json
github.com/gorilla/mux
golang.org/x/net/html
</pre>
<p>
The -f flag specifies an alternate format for the list, using the
syntax of package template. The default output is equivalent
to -f &#39;{{.ImportPath}}&#39;. The struct being passed to the template is:
</p>
<pre>type Package struct {
    Dir           string   // directory containing package sources
    ImportPath    string   // import path of package in dir
    ImportComment string   // path in import comment on package statement
    Name          string   // package name
    Doc           string   // package documentation string
    Target        string   // install path
    Shlib         string   // the shared library that contains this package (only set when -linkshared)
    Goroot        bool     // is this package in the Go root?
    Standard      bool     // is this package part of the standard Go library?
    Stale         bool     // would &#39;go install&#39; do anything for this package?
    StaleReason   string   // explanation for Stale==true
    Root          string   // Go root or Go path dir containing this package
    ConflictDir   string   // this directory shadows Dir in $GOPATH
    BinaryOnly    bool     // binary-only package (no longer supported)
    ForTest       string   // package is only for use in named test
    Export        string   // file containing export data (when using -export)
    Module        *Module  // info about package&#39;s containing module, if any (can be nil)
    Match         []string // command-line patterns matching this package
    DepOnly       bool     // package is only a dependency, not explicitly listed

    // Source files
    GoFiles         []string // .go source files (excluding CgoFiles, TestGoFiles, XTestGoFiles)
    CgoFiles        []string // .go source files that import &#34;C&#34;
    CompiledGoFiles []string // .go files presented to compiler (when using -compiled)
    IgnoredGoFiles  []string // .go source files ignored due to build constraints
    CFiles          []string // .c source files
    CXXFiles        []string // .cc, .cxx and .cpp source files
    MFiles          []string // .m source files
    HFiles          []string // .h, .hh, .hpp and .hxx source files
    FFiles          []string // .f, .F, .for and .f90 Fortran source files
    SFiles          []string // .s source files
    SwigFiles       []string // .swig files
    SwigCXXFiles    []string // .swigcxx files
    SysoFiles       []string // .syso object files to add to archive
    TestGoFiles     []string // _test.go files in package
    XTestGoFiles    []string // _test.go files outside package

    // Cgo directives
    CgoCFLAGS    []string // cgo: flags for C compiler
    CgoCPPFLAGS  []string // cgo: flags for C preprocessor
    CgoCXXFLAGS  []string // cgo: flags for C++ compiler
    CgoFFLAGS    []string // cgo: flags for Fortran compiler
    CgoLDFLAGS   []string // cgo: flags for linker
    CgoPkgConfig []string // cgo: pkg-config names

    // Dependency information
    Imports      []string          // import paths used by this package
    ImportMap    map[string]string // map from source import to ImportPath (identity entries omitted)
    Deps         []string          // all (recursively) imported dependencies
    TestImports  []string          // imports from TestGoFiles
    XTestImports []string          // imports from XTestGoFiles

    // Error information
    Incomplete bool            // this package or a dependency has an error
    Error      *PackageError   // error loading package
    DepsErrors []*PackageError // errors loading dependencies
}
</pre>
<p>
Packages stored in vendor directories report an ImportPath that includes the
path to the vendor directory (for example, &#34;d/vendor/p&#34; instead of &#34;p&#34;),
so that the ImportPath uniquely identifies a given copy of a package.
The Imports, Deps, TestImports, and XTestImports lists also contain these
expanded import paths. See golang.org/s/go15vendor for more about vendoring.
</p>
<p>
The error information, if any, is
</p>
<pre>type PackageError struct {
    ImportStack   []string // shortest path from package named on command line to this one
    Pos           string   // position of error (if present, file:line:col)
    Err           string   // the error itself
}
</pre>
<p>
The module information is a Module struct, defined in the discussion
of list -m below.
</p>
<p>
The template function &#34;join&#34; calls strings.Join.
</p>
<p>
The template function &#34;context&#34; returns the build context, defined as:
</p>
<pre>type Context struct {
    GOARCH        string   // target architecture
    GOOS          string   // target operating system
    GOROOT        string   // Go root
    GOPATH        string   // Go path
    CgoEnabled    bool     // whether cgo can be used
    UseAllFiles   bool     // use files regardless of +build lines, file names
    Compiler      string   // compiler to assume when computing target paths
    BuildTags     []string // build constraints to match in +build lines
    ReleaseTags   []string // releases the current release is compatible with
    InstallSuffix string   // suffix to use in the name of the install dir
}
</pre>
<p>
For more information about the meaning of these fields see the documentation
for the go/build package&#39;s Context type.
</p>
<p>
The -json flag causes the package data to be printed in JSON format
instead of using the template format.
</p>
<p>
The -compiled flag causes list to set CompiledGoFiles to the Go source
files presented to the compiler. Typically this means that it repeats
the files listed in GoFiles and then also adds the Go code generated
by processing CgoFiles and SwigFiles. The Imports list contains the
union of all imports from both GoFiles and CompiledGoFiles.
</p>
<p>
The -deps flag causes list to iterate over not just the named packages
but also all their dependencies. It visits them in a depth-first post-order
traversal, so that a package is listed only after all its dependencies.
Packages not explicitly listed on the command line will have the DepOnly
field set to true.
</p>
<p>
The -e flag changes the handling of erroneous packages, those that
cannot be found or are malformed. By default, the list command
prints an error to standard error for each erroneous package and
omits the packages from consideration during the usual printing.
With the -e flag, the list command never prints errors to standard
error and instead processes the erroneous packages with the usual
printing. Erroneous packages will have a non-empty ImportPath and
a non-nil Error field; other information may or may not be missing
(zeroed).
</p>
<p>
The -export flag causes list to set the Export field to the name of a
file containing up-to-date export information for the given package.
</p>
<p>
The -find flag causes list to identify the named packages but not
resolve their dependencies: the Imports and Deps lists will be empty.
</p>
<p>
The -test flag causes list to report not only the named packages
but also their test binaries (for packages with tests), to convey to
source code analysis tools exactly how test binaries are constructed.
The reported import path for a test binary is the import path of
the package followed by a &#34;.test&#34; suffix, as in &#34;math/rand.test&#34;.
When building a test, it is sometimes necessary to rebuild certain
dependencies specially for that test (most commonly the tested
package itself). The reported import path of a package recompiled
for a particular test binary is followed by a space and the name of
the test binary in brackets, as in &#34;math/rand [math/rand.test]&#34;
or &#34;regexp [sort.test]&#34;. The ForTest field is also set to the name
of the package being tested (&#34;math/rand&#34; or &#34;sort&#34; in the previous
examples).
</p>
<p>
The Dir, Target, Shlib, Root, ConflictDir, and Export file paths
are all absolute paths.
</p>
<p>
By default, the lists GoFiles, CgoFiles, and so on hold names of files in Dir
(that is, paths relative to Dir, not absolute paths).
The generated files added when using the -compiled and -test flags
are absolute paths referring to cached copies of generated Go source files.
Although they are Go source files, the paths may not end in &#34;.go&#34;.
</p>
<p>
The -m flag causes list to list modules instead of packages.
</p>
<p>
When listing modules, the -f flag still specifies a format template
applied to a Go struct, but now a Module struct:
</p>
<pre>type Module struct {
    Path      string       // module path
    Version   string       // module version
    Versions  []string     // available module versions (with -versions)
    Replace   *Module      // replaced by this module
    Time      *time.Time   // time version was created
    Update    *Module      // available update, if any (with -u)
    Main      bool         // is this the main module?
    Indirect  bool         // is this module only an indirect dependency of main module?
    Dir       string       // directory holding files for this module, if any
    GoMod     string       // path to go.mod file used when loading this module, if any
    GoVersion string       // go version used in module
    Error     *ModuleError // error loading module
}

type ModuleError struct {
    Err string // the error itself
}
</pre>
<p>
The file GoMod refers to may be outside the module directory if the
module is in the module cache or if the -modfile flag is used.
</p>
<p>
The default output is to print the module path and then
information about the version and replacement if any.
For example, &#39;go list -m all&#39; might print:
</p>
<pre>my/main/module
golang.org/x/text v0.3.0 =&gt; /tmp/text
rsc.io/pdf v0.1.1
</pre>
<p>
The Module struct has a String method that formats this
line of output, so that the default format is equivalent
to -f &#39;{{.String}}&#39;.
</p>
<p>
Note that when a module has been replaced, its Replace field
describes the replacement module, and its Dir field is set to
the replacement&#39;s source code, if present. (That is, if Replace
is non-nil, then Dir is set to Replace.Dir, with no access to
the replaced source code.)
</p>
<p>
The -u flag adds information about available upgrades.
When the latest version of a given module is newer than
the current one, list -u sets the Module&#39;s Update field
to information about the newer module.
The Module&#39;s String method indicates an available upgrade by
formatting the newer version in brackets after the current version.
For example, &#39;go list -m -u all&#39; might print:
</p>
<pre>my/main/module
golang.org/x/text v0.3.0 [v0.4.0] =&gt; /tmp/text
rsc.io/pdf v0.1.1 [v0.1.2]
</pre>
<p>
(For tools, &#39;go list -m -u -json all&#39; may be more convenient to parse.)
</p>
<p>
The -versions flag causes list to set the Module&#39;s Versions field
to a list of all known versions of that module, ordered according
to semantic versioning, earliest to latest. The flag also changes
the default output format to display the module path followed by the
space-separated version list.
</p>
<p>
The arguments to list -m are interpreted as a list of modules, not packages.
The main module is the module containing the current directory.
The active modules are the main module and its dependencies.
With no arguments, list -m shows the main module.
With arguments, list -m shows the modules specified by the arguments.
Any of the active modules can be specified by its module path.
The special pattern &#34;all&#34; specifies all the active modules, first the main
module and then dependencies sorted by module path.
A pattern containing &#34;...&#34; specifies the active modules whose
module paths match the pattern.
A query of the form path@version specifies the result of that query,
which is not limited to active modules.
See &#39;go help modules&#39; for more about module queries.
</p>
<p>
The template function &#34;module&#34; takes a single string argument
that must be a module path or query and returns the specified
module as a Module struct. If an error occurs, the result will
be a Module struct with a non-nil Error field.

<h3 id="hdr-Module_maintenance">Module maintenance</h3>
<p>
Go mod provides access to operations on modules.
</p>
<p>
Note that support for modules is built into all the go commands,
not just &#39;go mod&#39;. For example, day-to-day adding, removing, upgrading,
and downgrading of dependencies should be done using &#39;go get&#39;.
See &#39;go help modules&#39; for an overview of module functionality.
</p>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>go mod &lt;command&gt; [arguments]
</pre>
<p>
The commands are:
</p>
<pre>download    download modules to local cache
edit        edit go.mod from tools or scripts
graph       print module requirement graph
init        initialize new module in current directory
tidy        add missing and remove unused modules
vendor      make vendored copy of dependencies
verify      verify dependencies have expected content
why         explain why packages or modules are needed
</pre>
<p>
Use &#34;go help mod &lt;command&gt;&#34; for more information about a command.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Download_modules_to_local_cache">Download modules to local cache</h3>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>go mod download [-x] [-json] [modules]
</pre>
<p>
Download downloads the named modules, which can be module patterns selecting
dependencies of the main module or module queries of the form path@version.
With no arguments, download applies to all dependencies of the main module.
</p>
<p>
The go command will automatically download modules as needed during ordinary
execution. The &#34;go mod download&#34; command is useful mainly for pre-filling
the local cache or to compute the answers for a Go module proxy.
</p>
<p>
By default, download writes nothing to standard output. It may print progress
messages and errors to standard error.
</p>
<p>
The -json flag causes download to print a sequence of JSON objects
to standard output, describing each downloaded module (or failure),
corresponding to this Go struct:
</p>
<pre>type Module struct {
    Path     string // module path
    Version  string // module version
    Error    string // error loading module
    Info     string // absolute path to cached .info file
    GoMod    string // absolute path to cached .mod file
    Zip      string // absolute path to cached .zip file
    Dir      string // absolute path to cached source root directory
    Sum      string // checksum for path, version (as in go.sum)
    GoModSum string // checksum for go.mod (as in go.sum)
}
</pre>
<p>
The -x flag causes download to print the commands download executes.

<h3 id="hdr-Edit_go_mod_from_tools_or_scripts">Edit go.mod from tools or scripts</h3>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>go mod edit [editing flags] [go.mod]
</pre>
<p>
Edit provides a command-line interface for editing go.mod,
for use primarily by tools or scripts. It reads only go.mod;
it does not look up information about the modules involved.
By default, edit reads and writes the go.mod file of the main module,
but a different target file can be specified after the editing flags.
</p>
<p>
The editing flags specify a sequence of editing operations.
</p>
<p>
The -fmt flag reformats the go.mod file without making other changes.
This reformatting is also implied by any other modifications that use or
rewrite the go.mod file. The only time this flag is needed is if no other
flags are specified, as in &#39;go mod edit -fmt&#39;.
</p>
<p>
The -module flag changes the module&#39;s path (the go.mod file&#39;s module line).
</p>
<p>
The -require=path@version and -droprequire=path flags
add and drop a requirement on the given module path and version.
Note that -require overrides any existing requirements on path.
These flags are mainly for tools that understand the module graph.
Users should prefer &#39;go get path@version&#39; or &#39;go get path@none&#39;,
which make other go.mod adjustments as needed to satisfy
constraints imposed by other modules.
</p>
<p>
The -exclude=path@version and -dropexclude=path@version flags
add and drop an exclusion for the given module path and version.
Note that -exclude=path@version is a no-op if that exclusion already exists.
</p>
<p>
The -replace=old[@v]=new[@v] flag adds a replacement of the given
module path and version pair. If the @v in old@v is omitted, a
replacement without a version on the left side is added, which applies
to all versions of the old module path. If the @v in new@v is omitted,
the new path should be a local module root directory, not a module
path. Note that -replace overrides any redundant replacements for old[@v],
so omitting @v will drop existing replacements for specific versions.
</p>
<p>
The -dropreplace=old[@v] flag drops a replacement of the given
module path and version pair. If the @v is omitted, a replacement without
a version on the left side is dropped.
</p>
<p>
The -require, -droprequire, -exclude, -dropexclude, -replace,
and -dropreplace editing flags may be repeated, and the changes
are applied in the order given.
</p>
<p>
The -go=version flag sets the expected Go language version.
</p>
<p>
The -print flag prints the final go.mod in its text format instead of
writing it back to go.mod.
</p>
<p>
The -json flag prints the final go.mod file in JSON format instead of
writing it back to go.mod. The JSON output corresponds to these Go types:
</p>
<pre>type Module struct {
	Path string
	Version string
}

type GoMod struct {
	Module  Module
	Go      string
	Require []Require
	Exclude []Module
	Replace []Replace
}

type Require struct {
	Path string
	Version string
	Indirect bool
}

type Replace struct {
	Old Module
	New Module
}
</pre>
<p>
Note that this only describes the go.mod file itself, not other modules
referred to indirectly. For the full set of modules available to a build,
use &#39;go list -m -json all&#39;.
</p>
<p>
For example, a tool can obtain the go.mod as a data structure by
parsing the output of &#39;go mod edit -json&#39; and can then make changes
by invoking &#39;go mod edit&#39; with -require, -exclude, and so on.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Print_module_requirement_graph">Print module requirement graph</h3>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>go mod graph
</pre>
<p>
Graph prints the module requirement graph (with replacements applied)
in text form. Each line in the output has two space-separated fields: a module
and one of its requirements. Each module is identified as a string of the form
path@version, except for the main module, which has no @version suffix.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Initialize_new_module_in_current_directory">Initialize new module in current directory</h3>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>go mod init [module]
</pre>
<p>
Init initializes and writes a new go.mod to the current directory,
in effect creating a new module rooted at the current directory.
The file go.mod must not already exist.
If possible, init will guess the module path from import comments
(see &#39;go help importpath&#39;) or from version control configuration.
To override this guess, supply the module path as an argument.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Add_missing_and_remove_unused_modules">Add missing and remove unused modules</h3>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>go mod tidy [-v]
</pre>
<p>
Tidy makes sure go.mod matches the source code in the module.
It adds any missing modules necessary to build the current module&#39;s
packages and dependencies, and it removes unused modules that
don&#39;t provide any relevant packages. It also adds any missing entries
to go.sum and removes any unnecessary ones.
</p>
<p>
The -v flag causes tidy to print information about removed modules
to standard error.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Make_vendored_copy_of_dependencies">Make vendored copy of dependencies</h3>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>go mod vendor [-v]
</pre>
<p>
Vendor resets the main module&#39;s vendor directory to include all packages
needed to build and test all the main module&#39;s packages.
It does not include test code for vendored packages.
</p>
<p>
The -v flag causes vendor to print the names of vendored
modules and packages to standard error.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Verify_dependencies_have_expected_content">Verify dependencies have expected content</h3>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>go mod verify
</pre>
<p>
Verify checks that the dependencies of the current module,
which are stored in a local downloaded source cache, have not been
modified since being downloaded. If all the modules are unmodified,
verify prints &#34;all modules verified.&#34; Otherwise it reports which
modules have been changed and causes &#39;go mod&#39; to exit with a
non-zero status.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Explain_why_packages_or_modules_are_needed">Explain why packages or modules are needed</h3>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>go mod why [-m] [-vendor] packages...
</pre>
<p>
Why shows a shortest path in the import graph from the main module to
each of the listed packages. If the -m flag is given, why treats the
arguments as a list of modules and finds a path to any package in each
of the modules.
</p>
<p>
By default, why queries the graph of packages matched by &#34;go list all&#34;,
which includes tests for reachable packages. The -vendor flag causes why
to exclude tests of dependencies.
</p>
<p>
The output is a sequence of stanzas, one for each package or module
name on the command line, separated by blank lines. Each stanza begins
with a comment line &#34;# package&#34; or &#34;# module&#34; giving the target
package or module. Subsequent lines give a path through the import
graph, one package per line. If the package or module is not
referenced from the main module, the stanza will display a single
parenthesized note indicating that fact.
</p>
<p>
For example:
</p>
<pre>$ go mod why golang.org/x/text/language golang.org/x/text/encoding
# golang.org/x/text/language
rsc.io/quote
rsc.io/sampler
golang.org/x/text/language

# golang.org/x/text/encoding
(main module does not need package golang.org/x/text/encoding)
$
</pre>
<h3 id="hdr-Compile_and_run_Go_program">Compile and run Go program</h3>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>go run [build flags] [-exec xprog] package [arguments...]
</pre>
<p>
Run compiles and runs the named main Go package.
Typically the package is specified as a list of .go source files from a single directory,
but it may also be an import path, file system path, or pattern
matching a single known package, as in &#39;go run .&#39; or &#39;go run my/cmd&#39;.
</p>
<p>
By default, &#39;go run&#39; runs the compiled binary directly: &#39;a.out arguments...&#39;.
If the -exec flag is given, &#39;go run&#39; invokes the binary using xprog:
</p>
<pre>&#39;xprog a.out arguments...&#39;.
</pre>
<p>
If the -exec flag is not given, GOOS or GOARCH is different from the system
default, and a program named go_$GOOS_$GOARCH_exec can be found
on the current search path, &#39;go run&#39; invokes the binary using that program,
for example &#39;go_js_wasm_exec a.out arguments...&#39;. This allows execution of
cross-compiled programs when a simulator or other execution method is
available.
</p>
<p>
The exit status of Run is not the exit status of the compiled binary.
</p>
<p>

For more about specifying packages, see &#39;go help packages&#39;.
</p>
<p>
See also: go build.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Test_packages">Test packages</h3>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>go test [build/test flags] [packages] [build/test flags &amp; test binary flags]
</pre>
<p>
&#39;Go test&#39; automates testing the packages named by the import paths.
It prints a summary of the test results in the format:
</p>
<pre>ok   archive/tar   0.011s
FAIL archive/zip   0.022s
ok   compress/gzip 0.033s
...
</pre>
<p>
followed by detailed output for each failed package.
</p>
<p>
&#39;Go test&#39; recompiles each package along with any files with names matching
the file pattern &#34;*_test.go&#34;.
These additional files can contain test functions, benchmark functions, and
example functions. See &#39;go help testfunc&#39; for more.
Each listed package causes the execution of a separate test binary.
Files whose names begin with &#34;_&#34; (including &#34;_test.go&#34;) or &#34;.&#34; are ignored.
</p>
<p>
Test files that declare a package with the suffix &#34;_test&#34; will be compiled as a
separate package, and then linked and run with the main test binary.
</p>
<p>
The go tool will ignore a directory named &#34;testdata&#34;, making it available
to hold ancillary data needed by the tests.
</p>
<p>
As part of building a test binary, go test runs go vet on the package
and its test source files to identify significant problems. If go vet
finds any problems, go test reports those and does not run the test
binary. Only a high-confidence subset of the default go vet checks are
used. That subset is: &#39;atomic&#39;, &#39;bool&#39;, &#39;buildtags&#39;, &#39;nilfunc&#39;, and
&#39;printf&#39;. You can see the documentation for these and other vet tests
via &#34;go doc cmd/vet&#34;. To disable the running of go vet, use the
-vet=off flag.
</p>
<p>
All test output and summary lines are printed to the go command&#39;s
standard output, even if the test printed them to its own standard
error. (The go command&#39;s standard error is reserved for printing
errors building the tests.)
</p>
<p>
Go test runs in two different modes:
</p>
<p>
The first, called local directory mode, occurs when go test is
invoked with no package arguments (for example, &#39;go test&#39; or &#39;go
test -v&#39;). In this mode, go test compiles the package sources and
tests found in the current directory and then runs the resulting
test binary. In this mode, caching (discussed below) is disabled.
After the package test finishes, go test prints a summary line
showing the test status (&#39;ok&#39; or &#39;FAIL&#39;), package name, and elapsed
time.
</p>
<p>
The second, called package list mode, occurs when go test is invoked
with explicit package arguments (for example &#39;go test math&#39;, &#39;go
test ./...&#39;, and even &#39;go test .&#39;). In this mode, go test compiles
and tests each of the packages listed on the command line. If a
package test passes, go test prints only the final &#39;ok&#39; summary
line. If a package test fails, go test prints the full test output.
If invoked with the -bench or -v flag, go test prints the full
output even for passing package tests, in order to display the
requested benchmark results or verbose logging. After the package
tests for all of the listed packages finish, and their output is
printed, go test prints a final &#39;FAIL&#39; status if any package test
has failed.
</p>
<p>
In package list mode only, go test caches successful package test
results to avoid unnecessary repeated running of tests. When the
result of a test can be recovered from the cache, go test will
redisplay the previous output instead of running the test binary
again. When this happens, go test prints &#39;(cached)&#39; in place of the
elapsed time in the summary line.
</p>
<p>
The rule for a match in the cache is that the run involves the same
test binary and the flags on the command line come entirely from a
restricted set of &#39;cacheable&#39; test flags, defined as -cpu, -list,
-parallel, -run, -short, and -v. If a run of go test has any test
or non-test flags outside this set, the result is not cached. To
disable test caching, use any test flag or argument other than the
cacheable flags. The idiomatic way to disable test caching explicitly
is to use -count=1. Tests that open files within the package&#39;s source
root (usually $GOPATH) or that consult environment variables only
match future runs in which the files and environment variables are unchanged.
A cached test result is treated as executing in no time at all,
so a successful package test result will be cached and reused
regardless of -timeout setting.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the build flags, the flags handled by &#39;go test&#39; itself are:
</p>
<pre>-args
    Pass the remainder of the command line (everything after -args)
    to the test binary, uninterpreted and unchanged.
    Because this flag consumes the remainder of the command line,
    the package list (if present) must appear before this flag.

-c
    Compile the test binary to pkg.test but do not run it
    (where pkg is the last element of the package&#39;s import path).
    The file name can be changed with the -o flag.

-exec xprog
    Run the test binary using xprog. The behavior is the same as
    in &#39;go run&#39;. See &#39;go help run&#39; for details.

-i
    Install packages that are dependencies of the test.
    Do not run the test.

-json
    Convert test output to JSON suitable for automated processing.
    See &#39;go doc test2json&#39; for the encoding details.

-o file
    Compile the test binary to the named file.
    The test still runs (unless -c or -i is specified).
</pre>
<p>
The test binary also accepts flags that control execution of the test; these
flags are also accessible by &#39;go test&#39;. See &#39;go help testflag&#39; for details.

</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Run_specified_go_tool">Run specified go tool</h3>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>go tool [-n] command [args...]
</pre>
<p>
Tool runs the go tool command identified by the arguments.
With no arguments it prints the list of known tools.
</p>
<p>
The -n flag causes tool to print the command that would be
executed but not execute it.
</p>
<p>
For more about each tool command, see &#39;go doc cmd/&lt;command&gt;&#39;.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Print_Go_version">Print Go version</h3>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>go version [-m] [-v] [file ...]
</pre>
<p>
Version prints the build information for Go executables.
</p>
<p>
Go version reports the Go version used to build each of the named
executable files.
</p>
<p>
If no files are named on the command line, go version prints its own
version information.
</p>
<p>
If a directory is named, go version walks that directory, recursively,
looking for recognized Go binaries and reporting their versions.
By default, go version does not report unrecognized files found
during a directory scan. The -v flag causes it to report unrecognized files.
</p>
<p>
The -m flag causes go version to print each executable&#39;s embedded
module version information, when available. In the output, the module
information consists of multiple lines following the version line, each
indented by a leading tab character.
</p>
<p>
See also: go doc runtime/debug.BuildInfo.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Report_likely_mistakes_in_packages">Report likely mistakes in packages</h3>
<p>
Usage:
</p>
<pre>go vet [-n] [-x] [-vettool prog] [build flags] [vet flags] [packages]
</pre>
<p>
Vet runs the Go vet command on the packages named by the import paths.
</p>
<p>
For more about vet and its flags, see &#39;go doc cmd/vet&#39;.
For more about specifying packages, see &#39;go help packages&#39;.
For a list of checkers and their flags, see &#39;go tool vet help&#39;.
For details of a specific checker such as &#39;printf&#39;, see &#39;go tool vet help printf&#39;.
</p>
<p>
The -n flag prints commands that would be executed.
The -x flag prints commands as they are executed.
</p>
<p>
The -vettool=prog flag selects a different analysis tool with alternative
or additional checks.
For example, the &#39;shadow&#39; analyzer can be built and run using these commands:
</p>
<pre>go install golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/shadow/cmd/shadow
go vet -vettool=$(which shadow)
</pre>
<p>
The build flags supported by go vet are those that control package resolution
and execution, such as -n, -x, -v, -tags, and -toolexec.
For more about these flags, see &#39;go help build&#39;.
</p>
<p>
See also: go fmt, go fix.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Build_modes">Build modes</h3>
<p>
The &#39;go build&#39; and &#39;go install&#39; commands take a -buildmode argument which
indicates which kind of object file is to be built. Currently supported values
are:
</p>
<pre>-buildmode=archive
	Build the listed non-main packages into .a files. Packages named
	main are ignored.

-buildmode=c-archive
	Build the listed main package, plus all packages it imports,
	into a C archive file. The only callable symbols will be those
	functions exported using a cgo //export comment. Requires
	exactly one main package to be listed.

-buildmode=c-shared
	Build the listed main package, plus all packages it imports,
	into a C shared library. The only callable symbols will
	be those functions exported using a cgo //export comment.
	Requires exactly one main package to be listed.

-buildmode=default
	Listed main packages are built into executables and listed
	non-main packages are built into .a files (the default
	behavior).

-buildmode=shared
	Combine all the listed non-main packages into a single shared
	library that will be used when building with the -linkshared
	option. Packages named main are ignored.

-buildmode=exe
	Build the listed main packages and everything they import into
	executables. Packages not named main are ignored.

-buildmode=pie
	Build the listed main packages and everything they import into
	position independent executables (PIE). Packages not named
	main are ignored.

-buildmode=plugin
	Build the listed main packages, plus all packages that they
	import, into a Go plugin. Packages not named main are ignored.
</pre>
<p>
On AIX, when linking a C program that uses a Go archive built with
-buildmode=c-archive, you must pass -Wl,-bnoobjreorder to the C compiler.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Calling_between_Go_and_C">Calling between Go and C</h3>
<p>
There are two different ways to call between Go and C/C++ code.
</p>
<p>
The first is the cgo tool, which is part of the Go distribution. For
information on how to use it see the cgo documentation (go doc cmd/cgo).
</p>
<p>
The second is the SWIG program, which is a general tool for
interfacing between languages. For information on SWIG see
<a href="http://swig.org/">http://swig.org/</a>. When running go build, any file with a .swig
extension will be passed to SWIG. Any file with a .swigcxx extension
will be passed to SWIG with the -c++ option.
</p>
<p>
When either cgo or SWIG is used, go build will pass any .c, .m, .s, .S
or .sx files to the C compiler, and any .cc, .cpp, .cxx files to the C++
compiler. The CC or CXX environment variables may be set to determine
the C or C++ compiler, respectively, to use.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Build_and_test_caching">Build and test caching</h3>
<p>
The go command caches build outputs for reuse in future builds.
The default location for cache data is a subdirectory named go-build
in the standard user cache directory for the current operating system.
Setting the GOCACHE environment variable overrides this default,
and running &#39;go env GOCACHE&#39; prints the current cache directory.
</p>
<p>
The go command periodically deletes cached data that has not been
used recently. Running &#39;go clean -cache&#39; deletes all cached data.
</p>
<p>
The build cache correctly accounts for changes to Go source files,
compilers, compiler options, and so on: cleaning the cache explicitly
should not be necessary in typical use. However, the build cache
does not detect changes to C libraries imported with cgo.
If you have made changes to the C libraries on your system, you
will need to clean the cache explicitly or else use the -a build flag
(see &#39;go help build&#39;) to force rebuilding of packages that
depend on the updated C libraries.
</p>
<p>
The go command also caches successful package test results.
See &#39;go help test&#39; for details. Running &#39;go clean -testcache&#39; removes
all cached test results (but not cached build results).
</p>
<p>
The GODEBUG environment variable can enable printing of debugging
information about the state of the cache:
</p>
<p>
GODEBUG=gocacheverify=1 causes the go command to bypass the
use of any cache entries and instead rebuild everything and check
that the results match existing cache entries.
</p>
<p>
GODEBUG=gocachehash=1 causes the go command to print the inputs
for all of the content hashes it uses to construct cache lookup keys.
The output is voluminous but can be useful for debugging the cache.
</p>
<p>
GODEBUG=gocachetest=1 causes the go command to print details of its
decisions about whether to reuse a cached test result.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Environment_variables">Environment variables</h3>
<p>
The go command and the tools it invokes consult environment variables
for configuration. If an environment variable is unset, the go command
uses a sensible default setting. To see the effective setting of the
variable &lt;NAME&gt;, run &#39;go env &lt;NAME&gt;&#39;. To change the default setting,
run &#39;go env -w &lt;NAME&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt;&#39;. Defaults changed using &#39;go env -w&#39;
are recorded in a Go environment configuration file stored in the
per-user configuration directory, as reported by os.UserConfigDir.
The location of the configuration file can be changed by setting
the environment variable GOENV, and &#39;go env GOENV&#39; prints the
effective location, but &#39;go env -w&#39; cannot change the default location.
See &#39;go help env&#39; for details.
</p>
<p>
General-purpose environment variables:
</p>
<pre>GCCGO
	The gccgo command to run for &#39;go build -compiler=gccgo&#39;.
GOARCH
	The architecture, or processor, for which to compile code.
	Examples are amd64, 386, arm, ppc64.
GOBIN
	The directory where &#39;go install&#39; will install a command.
GOCACHE
	The directory where the go command will store cached

GODEBUG
	Enable various debugging facilities. See &#39;go doc runtime&#39;
	for details.
GOENV
	The location of the Go environment configuration file.
	Cannot be set using &#39;go env -w&#39;.
GOFLAGS
	A space-separated list of -flag=value settings to apply
	to go commands by default, when the given flag is known by
	the current command. Each entry must be a standalone flag.
	Because the entries are space-separated, flag values must
	not contain spaces. Flags listed on the command line
	are applied after this list and therefore override it.
GOINSECURE
	Comma-separated list of glob patterns (in the syntax of Go&#39;s path.Match)
	of module path prefixes that should always be fetched in an insecure
	manner. Only applies to dependencies that are being fetched directly.
GOOS
	The operating system for which to compile code.
	Examples are linux, darwin, windows, netbsd.
GOPATH
	For more details see: &#39;go help gopath&#39;.
GOPROXY
	URL of Go module proxy. See &#39;go help modules&#39;.
GOPRIVATE, GONOPROXY, GONOSUMDB
	Comma-separated list of glob patterns (in the syntax of Go&#39;s path.Match)
	of module path prefixes that should always be fetched directly
	or that should not be compared against the checksum database.
	See &#39;go help module-private&#39;.
GOROOT
	The root of the go tree.
GOSUMDB
	The name of checksum database to use and optionally its public key and
	URL. See &#39;go help module-auth&#39;.

	temporary source files, packages, and binaries.
</pre>
<p>
Environment variables for use with cgo:
</p>
<pre>AR
	The command to use to manipulate library archives when
	building with the gccgo compiler.
	The default is &#39;ar&#39;.
CC
	The command to use to compile C code.
CGO_ENABLED
	Whether the cgo command is supported. Either 0 or 1.
CGO_CFLAGS
	Flags that cgo will pass to the compiler when compiling
	C code.
CGO_CFLAGS_ALLOW
	A regular expression specifying additional flags to allow
	to appear in #cgo CFLAGS source code directives.
	Does not apply to the CGO_CFLAGS environment variable.
CGO_CFLAGS_DISALLOW
	A regular expression specifying flags that must be disallowed
	from appearing in #cgo CFLAGS source code directives.
	Does not apply to the CGO_CFLAGS environment variable.
CGO_CPPFLAGS, CGO_CPPFLAGS_ALLOW, CGO_CPPFLAGS_DISALLOW

</pre>
<h3 id="hdr-File_types">File types</h3>
<p>
The go command examines the contents of a restricted set of files
in each directory. It identifies which files to examine based on
the extension of the file name. These extensions are:
</p>
<pre>.go
	Go source files.
.c, .h
	C source files.
	If the package uses cgo or SWIG, these will be compiled with the
	OS-native compiler (typically gcc); otherwise they will
	trigger an error.
.cc, .cpp, .cxx, .hh, .hpp, .hxx
	C++ source files. Only useful with cgo or SWIG, and always
	compiled with the OS-native compiler.
.m
	Objective-C source files. Only useful with cgo, and always
	compiled with the OS-native compiler.
.s, .S, .sx
	Assembler source files.
	If the package uses cgo or SWIG, these will be assembled with the
	OS-native assembler (typically gcc (sic)); otherwise they
	will be assembled with the Go assembler.
.swig, .swigcxx
	SWIG definition files.
.syso
	System object files.
</pre>
<p>
Files of each of these types except .syso may contain build
constraints, but the go command stops scanning for build constraints
at the first item in the file that is not a blank line or //-style
line comment. See the go/build package documentation for
more details.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-The_go_mod_file">The go.mod file</h3>
<p>
A module version is defined by a tree of source files, with a go.mod
file in its root. When the go command is run, it looks in the current
directory and then successive parent directories to find the go.mod
marking the root of the main (current) module.
</p>
<p>
The go.mod file itself is line-oriented, with // comments but
no /* */ comments. Each line holds a single directive, made up of a
verb followed by arguments. For example:
</p>
<pre>module my/thing
go 1.12
require other/thing v1.0.2
require new/thing/v2 v2.3.4
exclude old/thing v1.2.3
replace bad/thing v1.4.5 =&gt; good/thing v1.4.5
</pre>
<p>
The verbs are
</p>
<pre>module, to define the module path;
go, to set the expected language version;
require, to require a particular module at a given version or later;
exclude, to exclude a particular module version from use; and
replace, to replace a module version with a different module version.
</pre>
<p>
Exclude and replace apply only in the main module&#39;s go.mod and are ignored
in dependencies.  See <a href="https://research.swtch.com/vgo-mvs">https://research.swtch.com/vgo-mvs</a> for details.
</p>
<p>
The leading verb can be factored out of adjacent lines to create a block,
like in Go imports:
</p>
<pre>require (
	new/thing v2.3.4
	old/thing v1.2.3
)
</pre>
<p>
The go.mod file is designed both to be edited directly and to be
easily updated by tools. The &#39;go mod edit&#39; command can be used to
parse and edit the go.mod file from programs and tools.
See &#39;go help mod edit&#39;.
</p>
<p>
The go command automatically updates go.mod each time it uses the
module graph, to make sure go.mod always accurately reflects reality
and is properly formatted. For example, consider this go.mod file:
</p>
<pre>module M

require (
        A v1
        B v1.0.0
        C v1.0.0
        D v1.2.3
        E dev
)

exclude D v1.2.3
</pre>
<p>
The update rewrites non-canonical version identifiers to semver form,
so A&#39;s v1 becomes v1.0.0 and E&#39;s dev becomes the pseudo-version for the
latest commit on the dev branch, perhaps v0.0.0-20180523231146-b3f5c0f6e5f1.
</p>
<p>
The update modifies requirements to respect exclusions, so the
requirement on the excluded D v1.2.3 is updated to use the next
available version of D, perhaps D v1.2.4 or D v1.3.0.
</p>
<p>
The update removes redundant or misleading requirements.
For example, if A v1.0.0 itself requires B v1.2.0 and C v1.0.0,
then go.mod&#39;s requirement of B v1.0.0 is misleading (superseded by
A&#39;s need for v1.2.0), and its requirement of C v1.0.0 is redundant
(implied by A&#39;s need for the same version), so both will be removed.
If module M contains packages that directly import packages from B or
C, then the requirements will be kept but updated to the actual
versions being used.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the update reformats the go.mod in a canonical formatting, so
that future mechanical changes will result in minimal diffs.
</p>
<p>
Because the module graph defines the meaning of import statements, any
commands that load packages also use and therefore update go.mod,
including go build, go get, go install, go list, go test, go mod graph,
go mod tidy, and go mod why.
</p>
<p>
The expected language version, set by the go directive, determines
which language features are available when compiling the module.
Language features available in that version will be available for use.
Language features removed in earlier versions, or added in later versions,
will not be available. Note that the language version does not affect
build tags, which are determined by the Go release being used.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-GOPATH_environment_variable">GOPATH environment variable</h3>
<p>
The Go path is used to resolve import statements.
It is implemented by and documented in the go/build package.
</p>
<p>
The GOPATH environment variable lists places to look for Go code.
On Unix, the value is a colon-separated string.
On Windows, the value is a semicolon-separated string.
On Plan 9, the value is a list.
</p>
<p>
If the environment variable is unset, GOPATH defaults
to a subdirectory named &#34;go&#34; in the user&#39;s home directory
($HOME/go on Unix, %USERPROFILE%\go on Windows),
unless that directory holds a Go distribution.
Run &#34;go env GOPATH&#34; to see the current GOPATH.
</p>
<p>
See <a href="https://golang.org/wiki/SettingGOPATH">https://golang.org/wiki/SettingGOPATH</a> to set a custom GOPATH.
</p>
<p>
Each directory listed in GOPATH must have a prescribed structure:
</p>
<p>
The src directory holds source code. The path below src
determines the import path or executable name.
</p>
<p>
The pkg directory holds installed package objects.
As in the Go tree, each target operating system and
architecture pair has its own subdirectory of pkg
(pkg/GOOS_GOARCH).
</p>
<p>
If DIR is a directory listed in the GOPATH, a package with
source in DIR/src/foo/bar can be imported as &#34;foo/bar&#34; and
has its compiled form installed to &#34;DIR/pkg/GOOS_GOARCH/foo/bar.a&#34;.
</p>
<p>
The bin directory holds compiled commands.
Each command is named for its source directory, but only
the final element, not the entire path. That is, the
command with source in DIR/src/foo/quux is installed into
DIR/bin/quux, not DIR/bin/foo/quux. The &#34;foo/&#34; prefix is stripped
so that you can add DIR/bin to your PATH to get at the
installed commands. If the GOBIN environment variable is
set, commands are installed to the directory it names instead
of DIR/bin. GOBIN must be an absolute path.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s an example directory layout:
</p>
<pre>GOPATH=/home/user/go

/home/user/go/
    src/
        foo/
            bar/               (go code in package bar)
                x.go
            quux/              (go code in package main)
                y.go
    bin/
        quux                   (installed command)
    pkg/
        linux_amd64/
            foo/
                bar.a          (installed package object)
</pre>
<p>
Go searches each directory listed in GOPATH to find source code,
but new packages are always downloaded into the first directory
in the list.
</p>
<p>
See <a href="https://golang.org/doc/code.html">https://golang.org/doc/code.html</a> for an example.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-GOPATH_and_Modules">GOPATH and Modules</h3>
<p>
When using modules, GOPATH is no longer used for resolving imports.
However, it is still used to store downloaded source code (in GOPATH/pkg/mod)
and compiled commands (in GOPATH/bin).
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Internal_Directories">Internal Directories</h3>
<p>
Code in or below a directory named &#34;internal&#34; is importable only
by code in the directory tree rooted at the parent of &#34;internal&#34;.
Here&#39;s an extended version of the directory layout above:
</p>
<pre>/home/user/go/
    src/
        crash/
            bang/              (go code in package bang)
                b.go
        foo/                   (go code in package foo)
            f.go
            bar/               (go code in package bar)
                x.go
            internal/
                baz/           (go code in package baz)
                    z.go
            quux/              (go code in package main)
                y.go
</pre>
<p>
The code in z.go is imported as &#34;foo/internal/baz&#34;, but that
import statement can only appear in source files in the subtree
rooted at foo. The source files foo/f.go, foo/bar/x.go, and
foo/quux/y.go can all import &#34;foo/internal/baz&#34;, but the source file
crash/bang/b.go cannot.
</p>
<p>
See <a href="https://golang.org/s/go14internal">https://golang.org/s/go14internal</a> for details.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Vendor_Directories">Vendor Directories</h3>
<p>
Go 1.6 includes support for using local copies of external dependencies
to satisfy imports of those dependencies, often referred to as vendoring.
</p>
<p>
Code below a directory named &#34;vendor&#34; is importable only
by code in the directory tree rooted at the parent of &#34;vendor&#34;,
and only using an import path that omits the prefix up to and
including the vendor element.
</p>
<p>
Here&#39;s the example from the previous section,
but with the &#34;internal&#34; directory renamed to &#34;vendor&#34;
and a new foo/vendor/crash/bang directory added:
</p>
<pre>/home/user/go/
    src/
        crash/
            bang/              (go code in package bang)
                b.go
        foo/                   (go code in package foo)
            f.go
            bar/               (go code in package bar)
                x.go
            vendor/
                crash/
                    bang/      (go code in package bang)
                        b.go
                baz/           (go code in package baz)
                    z.go
            quux/              (go code in package main)
                y.go
</pre>
<p>
The same visibility rules apply as for internal, but the code
in z.go is imported as &#34;baz&#34;, not as &#34;foo/vendor/baz&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Code in vendor directories deeper in the source tree shadows
code in higher directories. Within the subtree rooted at foo, an import
of &#34;crash/bang&#34; resolves to &#34;foo/vendor/crash/bang&#34;, not the
top-level &#34;crash/bang&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Code in vendor directories is not subject to import path
checking (see &#39;go help importpath&#39;).
</p>
<p>
When &#39;go get&#39; checks out or updates a git repository, it now also
updates submodules.
</p>
<p>
Vendor directories do not affect the placement of new repositories
being checked out for the first time by &#39;go get&#39;: those are always
placed in the main GOPATH, never in a vendor subtree.
</p>
<p>
See <a href="https://golang.org/s/go15vendor">https://golang.org/s/go15vendor</a> for details.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Legacy_GOPATH_go_get">Legacy GOPATH go get</h3>
<p>
The &#39;go get&#39; command changes behavior depending on whether the
go command is running in module-aware mode or legacy GOPATH mode.
This help text, accessible as &#39;go help gopath-get&#39; even in module-aware mode,
describes &#39;go get&#39; as it operates in legacy GOPATH mode.
</p>
<p>
Usage: go get [-d] [-f] [-t] [-u] [-v] [-fix] [-insecure] [build flags] [packages]
</p>
<p>
Get downloads the packages named by the import paths, along with their
dependencies. It then installs the named packages, like &#39;go install&#39;.
</p>
<p>
The -d flag instructs get to stop after downloading the packages; that is,
it instructs get not to install the packages.
</p>
<p>
The -f flag, valid only when -u is set, forces get -u not to verify that
each package has been checked out from the source control repository
implied by its import path. This can be useful if the source is a local fork
of the original.
</p>
<p>
The -fix flag instructs get to run the fix tool on the downloaded packages
before resolving dependencies or building the code.
</p>
<p>
The -insecure flag permits fetching from repositories and resolving
custom domains using insecure schemes such as HTTP. Use with caution.
</p>
<p>
The -t flag instructs get to also download the packages required to build
the tests for the specified packages.
</p>
<p>
The -u flag instructs get to use the network to update the named packages
and their dependencies. By default, get uses the network to check out
missing packages but does not use it to look for updates to existing packages.
</p>
<p>
The -v flag enables verbose progress and debug output.
</p>
<p>
Get also accepts build flags to control the installation. See &#39;go help build&#39;.
</p>
<p>
When checking out a new package, get creates the target directory
GOPATH/src/&lt;import-path&gt;. If the GOPATH contains multiple entries,
get uses the first one. For more details see: &#39;go help gopath&#39;.
</p>
<p>
When checking out or updating a package, get looks for a branch or tag
that matches the locally installed version of Go. The most important
rule is that if the local installation is running version &#34;go1&#34;, get
searches for a branch or tag named &#34;go1&#34;. If no such version exists
it retrieves the default branch of the package.
</p>
<p>
When go get checks out or updates a Git repository,
it also updates any git submodules referenced by the repository.
</p>
<p>
Get never checks out or updates code stored in vendor directories.
</p>
<p>
For more about specifying packages, see &#39;go help packages&#39;.
</p>
<p>
For more about how &#39;go get&#39; finds source code to
download, see &#39;go help importpath&#39;.
</p>
<p>
This text describes the behavior of get when using GOPATH
to manage source code and dependencies.
If instead the go command is running in module-aware mode,
the details of get&#39;s flags and effects change, as does &#39;go help get&#39;.
See &#39;go help modules&#39; and &#39;go help module-get&#39;.
</p>
<p>
See also: go build, go install, go clean.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Module_proxy_protocol">Module proxy protocol</h3>
<p>
A Go module proxy is any web server that can respond to GET requests for
URLs of a specified form. The requests have no query parameters, so even
a site serving from a fixed file system (including a file:/// URL)
can be a module proxy.
</p>
<p>
The GET requests sent to a Go module proxy are:
</p>
<p>
GET $GOPROXY/&lt;module&gt;/@v/list returns a list of known versions of the given
module, one per line.
</p>
<p>
GET $GOPROXY/&lt;module&gt;/@v/&lt;version&gt;.info returns JSON-formatted metadata
about that version of the given module.
</p>
<p>
GET $GOPROXY/&lt;module&gt;/@v/&lt;version&gt;.mod returns the go.mod file
for that version of the given module.
</p>
<p>
GET $GOPROXY/&lt;module&gt;/@v/&lt;version&gt;.zip returns the zip archive
for that version of the given module.
</p>
<p>
GET $GOPROXY/&lt;module&gt;/@latest returns JSON-formatted metadata about the
latest known version of the given module in the same format as
&lt;module&gt;/@v/&lt;version&gt;.info. The latest version should be the version of
the module the go command may use if &lt;module&gt;/@v/list is empty or no
listed version is suitable. &lt;module&gt;/@latest is optional and may not
be implemented by a module proxy.
</p>
<p>
When resolving the latest version of a module, the go command will request
&lt;module&gt;/@v/list, then, if no suitable versions are found, &lt;module&gt;/@latest.
The go command prefers, in order: the semantically highest release version,
the semantically highest pre-release version, and the chronologically
most recent pseudo-version. In Go 1.12 and earlier, the go command considered
pseudo-versions in &lt;module&gt;/@v/list to be pre-release versions, but this is
no longer true since Go 1.13.
</p>
<p>
To avoid problems when serving from case-sensitive file systems,
the &lt;module&gt; and &lt;version&gt; elements are case-encoded, replacing every
uppercase letter with an exclamation mark followed by the corresponding
lower-case letter: github.com/Azure encodes as github.com/!azure.
</p>
<p>
The JSON-formatted metadata about a given module corresponds to
this Go data structure, which may be expanded in the future:
</p>
<pre>type Info struct {
    Version string    // version string
    Time    time.Time // commit time
}
</pre>
<p>
The zip archive for a specific version of a given module is a
standard zip file that contains the file tree corresponding
to the module&#39;s source code and related files. The archive uses
slash-separated paths, and every file path in the archive must
begin with &lt;module&gt;@&lt;version&gt;/, where the module and version are
substituted directly, not case-encoded. The root of the module
file tree corresponds to the &lt;module&gt;@&lt;version&gt;/ prefix in the
archive.
</p>
<p>
Even when downloading directly from version control systems,
the go command synthesizes explicit info, mod, and zip files
and stores them in its local cache, $GOPATH/pkg/mod/cache/download,
the same as if it had downloaded them directly from a proxy.
The cache layout is the same as the proxy URL space, so
serving $GOPATH/pkg/mod/cache/download at (or copying it to)
<a href="https://example.com/proxy">https://example.com/proxy</a> would let other users access those
cached module versions with GOPROXY=<a href="https://example.com/proxy">https://example.com/proxy</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Import_path_syntax">Import path syntax</h3>
<p>
An import path (see &#39;go help packages&#39;) denotes a package stored in the local
file system. In general, an import path denotes either a standard package (such
as &#34;unicode/utf8&#34;) or a package found in one of the work spaces (For more
details see: &#39;go help gopath&#39;).
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Relative_import_paths">Relative import paths</h3>
<p>
An import path beginning with ./ or ../ is called a relative path.
The toolchain supports relative import paths as a shortcut in two ways.
</p>
<p>
First, a relative path can be used as a shorthand on the command line.
If you are working in the directory containing the code imported as
&#34;unicode&#34; and want to run the tests for &#34;unicode/utf8&#34;, you can type
&#34;go test ./utf8&#34; instead of needing to specify the full path.
Similarly, in the reverse situation, &#34;go test ..&#34; will test &#34;unicode&#34; from
the &#34;unicode/utf8&#34; directory. Relative patterns are also allowed, like
&#34;go test ./...&#34; to test all subdirectories. See &#39;go help packages&#39; for details
on the pattern syntax.
</p>
<p>
Second, if you are compiling a Go program not in a work space,
you can use a relative path in an import statement in that program
to refer to nearby code also not in a work space.
This makes it easy to experiment with small multipackage programs
outside of the usual work spaces, but such programs cannot be
installed with &#34;go install&#34; (there is no work space in which to install them),
so they are rebuilt from scratch each time they are built.
To avoid ambiguity, Go programs cannot use relative import paths
within a work space.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Remote_import_paths">Remote import paths</h3>
<p>
Certain import paths also
describe how to obtain the source code for the package using
a revision control system.
</p>
<p>
A few common code hosting sites have special syntax:

<p>
For code hosted on other servers, import paths may either be qualified
with the version control type, or the go tool can dynamically fetch
the import path over https/http and discover where the code resides
from a &lt;meta&gt; tag in the HTML.
</p>
<p>
To declare the code location, an import path of the form
</p>
<pre>repository.vcs/path
</pre>
<p>
specifies the given repository, with or without the .vcs suffix,
using the named version control system, and then the path inside
that repository. The supported version control systems are:
</p>
<pre>Bazaar      .bzr
Fossil      .fossil
Git         .git
Mercurial   .hg
Subversion  .svn
</pre>
<p>
For example,
</p>
<pre>import &#34;example.org/user/foo.hg&#34;
</pre>
<p>
denotes the root directory of the Mercurial repository at
example.org/user/foo or foo.hg, and
</p>
<pre>import &#34;example.org/repo.git/foo/bar&#34;
</pre>
<p>
denotes the foo/bar directory of the Git repository at
example.org/repo or repo.git.
</p>
<p>
When a version control system supports multiple protocols,
each is tried in turn when downloading. For example, a Git
download tries https://, then git+ssh://.
</p>
<p>
By default, downloads are restricted to known secure protocols
(e.g. https, ssh). To override this setting for Git downloads, the
GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL environment variable can be set (For more details see:
&#39;go help environment&#39;).
</p>
<p>
If the import path is not a known code hosting site and also lacks a
version control qualifier, the go tool attempts to fetch the import
over https/http and looks for a &lt;meta&gt; tag in the document&#39;s HTML
&lt;head&gt;.
</p>
<p>
The meta tag has the form:
</p>
<pre>&lt;meta name=&#34;go-import&#34; content=&#34;import-prefix vcs repo-root&#34;&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The import-prefix is the import path corresponding to the repository
root. It must be a prefix or an exact match of the package being
fetched with &#34;go get&#34;. If it&#39;s not an exact match, another http
request is made at the prefix to verify the &lt;meta&gt; tags match.
</p>
<p>
The meta tag should appear as early in the file as possible.
In particular, it should appear before any raw JavaScript or CSS,
to avoid confusing the go command&#39;s restricted parser.
</p>
<p>
The vcs is one of &#34;bzr&#34;, &#34;fossil&#34;, &#34;git&#34;, &#34;hg&#34;, &#34;svn&#34;.
</p>
<p>
The repo-root is the root of the version control system
containing a scheme and not containing a .vcs qualifier.
</p>
<p>
For example,
</p>
<pre>import &#34;example.org/pkg/foo&#34;
</pre>
<p>
will result in the following requests:
</p>
<pre><a href="https://example.org/pkg/foo?go-get=1">https://example.org/pkg/foo?go-get=1</a> (preferred)
<a href="http://example.org/pkg/foo?go-get=1">http://example.org/pkg/foo?go-get=1</a>  (fallback, only with -insecure)
</pre>
<p>
If that page contains the meta tag
</p>
<pre>&lt;meta name=&#34;go-import&#34; content=&#34;example.org git <a href="https://code.org/r/p/exproj">https://code.org/r/p/exproj</a>&#34;&gt;
</pre>
<p>
the go tool will verify that <a href="https://example.org/?go-get=1">https://example.org/?go-get=1</a> contains the
same meta tag and then git clone <a href="https://code.org/r/p/exproj">https://code.org/r/p/exproj</a> into
GOPATH/src/example.org.
</p>
<p>
When using GOPATH, downloaded packages are written to the first directory
listed in the GOPATH environment variable.
(See &#39;go help gopath-get&#39; and &#39;go help gopath&#39;.)
</p>
<p>
When using modules, downloaded packages are stored in the module cache.
(See &#39;go help module-get&#39; and &#39;go help goproxy&#39;.)
</p>
<p>
When using modules, an additional variant of the go-import meta tag is
recognized and is preferred over those listing version control systems.
That variant uses &#34;mod&#34; as the vcs in the content value, as in:
</p>
<pre>&lt;meta name=&#34;go-import&#34; content=&#34;example.org mod <a href="https://code.org/moduleproxy">https://code.org/moduleproxy</a>&#34;&gt;
</pre>
<p>
This tag means to fetch modules with paths beginning with example.org
from the module proxy available at the URL <a href="https://code.org/moduleproxy">https://code.org/moduleproxy</a>.
See &#39;go help goproxy&#39; for details about the proxy protocol.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Import_path_checking">Import path checking</h3>
<p>
When the custom import path feature described above redirects to a
known code hosting site, each of the resulting packages has two possible
import paths, using the custom domain or the known hosting site.
</p>
<p>
A package statement is said to have an &#34;import comment&#34; if it is immediately
followed (before the next newline) by a comment of one of these two forms:
</p>
<pre>package math // import &#34;path&#34;
package math /* import &#34;path&#34; */
</pre>
<p>
The go command will refuse to install a package with an import comment
unless it is being referred to by that import path. In this way, import comments
let package authors make sure the custom import path is used and not a
direct path to the underlying code hosting site.
</p>
<p>
Import path checking is disabled for code found within vendor trees.
This makes it possible to copy code into alternate locations in vendor trees
without needing to update import comments.
</p>
<p>
Import path checking is also disabled when using modules.
Import path comments are obsoleted by the go.mod file&#39;s module statement.
</p>
<p>
See <a href="https://golang.org/s/go14customimport">https://golang.org/s/go14customimport</a> for details.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Modules__module_versions__and_more">Modules, module versions, and more</h3>
<p>
A module is a collection of related Go packages.
Modules are the unit of source code interchange and versioning.
The go command has direct support for working with modules,
including recording and resolving dependencies on other modules.
Modules replace the old GOPATH-based approach to specifying
which source files are used in a given build.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Module_support">Module support</h3>
<p>
The go command includes support for Go modules. Module-aware mode is active
by default whenever a go.mod file is found in the current directory or in
any parent directory.
</p>
<p>
The quickest way to take advantage of module support is to check out your
repository, create a go.mod file (described in the next section) there, and run
go commands from within that file tree.
</p>
<p>
For more fine-grained control, the go command continues to respect
a temporary environment variable, GO111MODULE, which can be set to one
of three string values: off, on, or auto (the default).
If GO111MODULE=on, then the go command requires the use of modules,
never consulting GOPATH. We refer to this as the command
being module-aware or running in &#34;module-aware mode&#34;.
If GO111MODULE=off, then the go command never uses
module support. Instead it looks in vendor directories and GOPATH
to find dependencies; we now refer to this as &#34;GOPATH mode.&#34;
If GO111MODULE=auto or is unset, then the go command enables or disables
module support based on the current directory.
Module support is enabled only when the current directory contains a
go.mod file or is below a directory containing a go.mod file.
</p>
<p>
In module-aware mode, GOPATH no longer defines the meaning of imports
during a build, but it still stores downloaded dependencies (in GOPATH/pkg/mod)
and installed commands (in GOPATH/bin, unless GOBIN is set).
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Defining_a_module">Defining a module</h3>
<p>
A module is defined by a tree of Go source files with a go.mod file
in the tree&#39;s root directory. The directory containing the go.mod file
is called the module root. Typically the module root will also correspond
to a source code repository root (but in general it need not).
The module is the set of all Go packages in the module root and its
subdirectories, but excluding subtrees with their own go.mod files.
</p>
<p>
The &#34;module path&#34; is the import path prefix corresponding to the module root.
The go.mod file defines the module path and lists the specific versions
of other modules that should be used when resolving imports during a build,
by giving their module paths and versions.
</p>
<p>
For example, this go.mod declares that the directory containing it is the root
of the module with path example.com/m, and it also declares that the module
depends on specific versions of golang.org/x/text and gopkg.in/yaml.v2:
</p>
<pre>module example.com/m

require (
	golang.org/x/text v0.3.0
	gopkg.in/yaml.v2 v2.1.0
)
</pre>
<p>
The go.mod file can also specify replacements and excluded versions
that only apply when building the module directly; they are ignored
when the module is incorporated into a larger build.
For more about the go.mod file, see &#39;go help go.mod&#39;.
</p>
<p>
To start a new module, simply create a go.mod file in the root of the
module&#39;s directory tree, containing only a module statement.
The &#39;go mod init&#39; command can be used to do this:
</p>
<pre>go mod init example.com/m
</pre>
<p>
In a project already using an existing dependency management tool like
godep, glide, or dep, &#39;go mod init&#39; will also add require statements
matching the existing configuration.
</p>
<p>
Once the go.mod file exists, no additional steps are required:
go commands like &#39;go build&#39;, &#39;go test&#39;, or even &#39;go list&#39; will automatically
add new dependencies as needed to satisfy imports.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-The_main_module_and_the_build_list">The main module and the build list</h3>
<p>
The &#34;main module&#34; is the module containing the directory where the go command
is run. The go command finds the module root by looking for a go.mod in the
current directory, or else the current directory&#39;s parent directory,
or else the parent&#39;s parent directory, and so on.
</p>
<p>
The main module&#39;s go.mod file defines the precise set of packages available
for use by the go command, through require, replace, and exclude statements.
Dependency modules, found by following require statements, also contribute
to the definition of that set of packages, but only through their go.mod
files&#39; require statements: any replace and exclude statements in dependency
modules are ignored. The replace and exclude statements therefore allow the
main module complete control over its own build, without also being subject
to complete control by dependencies.
</p>
<p>
The set of modules providing packages to builds is called the &#34;build list&#34;.
The build list initially contains only the main module. Then the go command
adds to the list the exact module versions required by modules already
on the list, recursively, until there is nothing left to add to the list.
If multiple versions of a particular module are added to the list,
then at the end only the latest version (according to semantic version
ordering) is kept for use in the build.
</p>
<p>
The &#39;go list&#39; command provides information about the main module
and the build list. For example:
</p>
<pre>go list -m              # print path of main module
go list -m -f={{.Dir}}  # print root directory of main module
go list -m all          # print build list
</pre>
<h3 id="hdr-Maintaining_module_requirements">Maintaining module requirements</h3>
<p>
The go.mod file is meant to be readable and editable by both
programmers and tools. The go command itself automatically updates the go.mod file
to maintain a standard formatting and the accuracy of require statements.
</p>
<p>
Any go command that finds an unfamiliar import will look up the module
containing that import and add the latest version of that module
to go.mod automatically. In most cases, therefore, it suffices to
add an import to source code and run &#39;go build&#39;, &#39;go test&#39;, or even &#39;go list&#39;:
as part of analyzing the package, the go command will discover
and resolve the import and update the go.mod file.
</p>
<p>
Any go command can determine that a module requirement is
missing and must be added, even when considering only a single
package from the module. On the other hand, determining that a module requirement
is no longer necessary and can be deleted requires a full view of
all packages in the module, across all possible build configurations
(architectures, operating systems, build tags, and so on).
The &#39;go mod tidy&#39; command builds that view and then
adds any missing module requirements and removes unnecessary ones.
</p>
<p>
As part of maintaining the require statements in go.mod, the go command
tracks which ones provide packages imported directly by the current module
and which ones provide packages only used indirectly by other module
dependencies. Requirements needed only for indirect uses are marked with a
&#34;// indirect&#34; comment in the go.mod file. Indirect requirements are
automatically removed from the go.mod file once they are implied by other
direct requirements. Indirect requirements only arise when using modules
that fail to state some of their own dependencies or when explicitly
upgrading a module&#39;s dependencies ahead of its own stated requirements.
</p>
<p>
Because of this automatic maintenance, the information in go.mod is an
up-to-date, readable description of the build.
</p>
<p>
The &#39;go get&#39; command updates go.mod to change the module versions used in a
build. An upgrade of one module may imply upgrading others, and similarly a
downgrade of one module may imply downgrading others. The &#39;go get&#39; command
makes these implied changes as well. If go.mod is edited directly, commands
like &#39;go build&#39; or &#39;go list&#39; will assume that an upgrade is intended and
automatically make any implied upgrades and update go.mod to reflect them.
</p>
<p>
The &#39;go mod&#39; command provides other functionality for use in maintaining
and understanding modules and go.mod files. See &#39;go help mod&#39;.
</p>
<p>
The -mod build flag provides additional control over updating and use of go.mod.
</p>
<p>
If invoked with -mod=readonly, the go command is disallowed from the implicit
automatic updating of go.mod described above. Instead, it fails when any changes
to go.mod are needed. This setting is most useful to check that go.mod does
not need updates, such as in a continuous integration and testing system.
The &#34;go get&#34; command remains permitted to update go.mod even with -mod=readonly,
and the &#34;go mod&#34; commands do not take the -mod flag (or any other build flags).
</p>
<p>
If invoked with -mod=vendor, the go command loads packages from the main
module&#39;s vendor directory instead of downloading modules to and loading packages
from the module cache. The go command assumes the vendor directory holds
correct copies of dependencies, and it does not compute the set of required
module versions from go.mod files. However, the go command does check that
vendor/modules.txt (generated by &#39;go mod vendor&#39;) contains metadata consistent
with go.mod.
</p>
<p>
If invoked with -mod=mod, the go command loads modules from the module cache
even if there is a vendor directory present.
</p>
<p>
If the go command is not invoked with a -mod flag and the vendor directory
is present and the &#34;go&#34; version in go.mod is 1.14 or higher, the go command
will act as if it were invoked with -mod=vendor.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Pseudo_versions">Pseudo-versions</h3>
<p>
The go.mod file and the go command more generally use semantic versions as
the standard form for describing module versions, so that versions can be
compared to determine which should be considered earlier or later than another.
A module version like v1.2.3 is introduced by tagging a revision in the
underlying source repository. Untagged revisions can be referred to
using a &#34;pseudo-version&#34; like v0.0.0-yyyymmddhhmmss-abcdefabcdef,
where the time is the commit time in UTC and the final suffix is the prefix
of the commit hash. The time portion ensures that two pseudo-versions can
be compared to determine which happened later, the commit hash identifes
the underlying commit, and the prefix (v0.0.0- in this example) is derived from
the most recent tagged version in the commit graph before this commit.
</p>
<p>
There are three pseudo-version forms:
</p>
<p>
vX.0.0-yyyymmddhhmmss-abcdefabcdef is used when there is no earlier
versioned commit with an appropriate major version before the target commit.
(This was originally the only form, so some older go.mod files use this form
even for commits that do follow tags.)
</p>
<p>
vX.Y.Z-pre.0.yyyymmddhhmmss-abcdefabcdef is used when the most
recent versioned commit before the target commit is vX.Y.Z-pre.
</p>
<p>
vX.Y.(Z+1)-0.yyyymmddhhmmss-abcdefabcdef is used when the most
recent versioned commit before the target commit is vX.Y.Z.
</p>
<p>
Pseudo-versions never need to be typed by hand: the go command will accept
the plain commit hash and translate it into a pseudo-version (or a tagged
version if available) automatically. This conversion is an example of a
module query.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Module_queries">Module queries</h3>
<p>
The go command accepts a &#34;module query&#34; in place of a module version
both on the command line and in the main module&#39;s go.mod file.
(After evaluating a query found in the main module&#39;s go.mod file,
the go command updates the file to replace the query with its result.)
</p>
<p>
A fully-specified semantic version, such as &#34;v1.2.3&#34;,
evaluates to that specific version.
</p>
<p>
A semantic version prefix, such as &#34;v1&#34; or &#34;v1.2&#34;,
evaluates to the latest available tagged version with that prefix.
</p>
<p>
A semantic version comparison, such as &#34;&lt;v1.2.3&#34; or &#34;&gt;=v1.5.6&#34;,
evaluates to the available tagged version nearest to the comparison target
(the latest version for &lt; and &lt;=, the earliest version for &gt; and &gt;=).
</p>
<p>
The string &#34;latest&#34; matches the latest available tagged version,
or else the underlying source repository&#39;s latest untagged revision.
</p>
<p>
The string &#34;upgrade&#34; is like &#34;latest&#34;, but if the module is
currently required at a later version than the version &#34;latest&#34;
would select (for example, a newer pre-release version), &#34;upgrade&#34;
will select the later version instead.
</p>
<p>
The string &#34;patch&#34; matches the latest available tagged version
of a module with the same major and minor version numbers as the
currently required version. If no version is currently required,
&#34;patch&#34; is equivalent to &#34;latest&#34;.
</p>
<p>
A revision identifier for the underlying source repository, such as
a commit hash prefix, revision tag, or branch name, selects that
specific code revision. If the revision is also tagged with a
semantic version, the query evaluates to that semantic version.
Otherwise the query evaluates to a pseudo-version for the commit.
Note that branches and tags with names that are matched by other
query syntax cannot be selected this way. For example, the query
&#34;v2&#34; means the latest version starting with &#34;v2&#34;, not the branch
named &#34;v2&#34;.
</p>
<p>
All queries prefer release versions to pre-release versions.
For example, &#34;&lt;v1.2.3&#34; will prefer to return &#34;v1.2.2&#34;
instead of &#34;v1.2.3-pre1&#34;, even though &#34;v1.2.3-pre1&#34; is nearer
to the comparison target.
</p>
<p>
Module versions disallowed by exclude statements in the
main module&#39;s go.mod are considered unavailable and cannot
be returned by queries.
</p>
<p>
For example, these commands are all valid:
</p>
<pre>go get github.com/gorilla/mux@latest    # same (@latest is default for &#39;go get&#39;)
go get github.com/gorilla/mux@v1.6.2    # records v1.6.2
go get github.com/gorilla/mux@e3702bed2 # records v1.6.2
go get github.com/gorilla/mux@c856192   # records v0.0.0-20180517173623-c85619274f5d
go get github.com/gorilla/mux@master    # records current meaning of master
</pre>
<h3 id="hdr-Module_compatibility_and_semantic_versioning">Module compatibility and semantic versioning</h3>
<p>
The go command requires that modules use semantic versions and expects that
the versions accurately describe compatibility: it assumes that v1.5.4 is a
backwards-compatible replacement for v1.5.3, v1.4.0, and even v1.0.0.
More generally the go command expects that packages follow the
&#34;import compatibility rule&#34;, which says:
</p>
<p>
&#34;If an old package and a new package have the same import path,
the new package must be backwards compatible with the old package.&#34;
</p>
<p>
Because the go command assumes the import compatibility rule,
a module definition can only set the minimum required version of one
of its dependencies: it cannot set a maximum or exclude selected versions.
Still, the import compatibility rule is not a guarantee: it may be that
v1.5.4 is buggy and not a backwards-compatible replacement for v1.5.3.
Because of this, the go command never updates from an older version
to a newer version of a module unasked.
</p>
<p>
In semantic versioning, changing the major version number indicates a lack
of backwards compatibility with earlier versions. To preserve import
compatibility, the go command requires that modules with major version v2
or later use a module path with that major version as the final element.
For example, version v2.0.0 of example.com/m must instead use module path
example.com/m/v2, and packages in that module would use that path as
their import path prefix, as in example.com/m/v2/sub/pkg. Including the
major version number in the module path and import paths in this way is
called &#34;semantic import versioning&#34;. Pseudo-versions for modules with major
version v2 and later begin with that major version instead of v0, as in
v2.0.0-20180326061214-4fc5987536ef.
</p>
<p>
As a special case, module paths beginning with gopkg.in/ continue to use the
conventions established on that system: the major version is always present,
and it is preceded by a dot instead of a slash: gopkg.in/yaml.v1
and gopkg.in/yaml.v2, not gopkg.in/yaml and gopkg.in/yaml/v2.
</p>
<p>
The go command treats modules with different module paths as unrelated:
it makes no connection between example.com/m and example.com/m/v2.
Modules with different major versions can be used together in a build
and are kept separate by the fact that their packages use different
import paths.
</p>
<p>
In semantic versioning, major version v0 is for initial development,
indicating no expectations of stability or backwards compatibility.
Major version v0 does not appear in the module path, because those
versions are preparation for v1.0.0, and v1 does not appear in the
module path either.
</p>
<p>
Code written before the semantic import versioning convention
was introduced may use major versions v2 and later to describe
the same set of unversioned import paths as used in v0 and v1.
To accommodate such code, if a source code repository has a
v2.0.0 or later tag for a file tree with no go.mod, the version is
considered to be part of the v1 module&#39;s available versions
and is given an +incompatible suffix when converted to a module
version, as in v2.0.0+incompatible. The +incompatible tag is also
applied to pseudo-versions derived from such versions, as in
v2.0.1-0.yyyymmddhhmmss-abcdefabcdef+incompatible.
</p>
<p>
In general, having a dependency in the build list (as reported by &#39;go list -m all&#39;)
on a v0 version, pre-release version, pseudo-version, or +incompatible version
is an indication that problems are more likely when upgrading that
dependency, since there is no expectation of compatibility for those.

</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Module_downloading_and_verification">Module downloading and verification</h3>
<p>
The go command can fetch modules from a proxy or connect to source control
servers directly, according to the setting of the GOPROXY environment
variable (see &#39;go help env&#39;). The default setting for GOPROXY is
&#34;<a href="https://proxy.golang.org,direct">https://proxy.golang.org,direct</a>&#34;, which means to try the
Go module mirror run by Google and fall back to a direct connection
if the proxy reports that it does not have the module (HTTP error 404 or 410).
See <a href="https://proxy.golang.org/privacy">https://proxy.golang.org/privacy</a> for the service&#39;s privacy policy.
If GOPROXY is set to the string &#34;direct&#34;, downloads use a direct connection
to source control servers. Setting GOPROXY to &#34;off&#34; disallows downloading
modules from any source. Otherwise, GOPROXY is expected to be a comma-separated
list of the URLs of module proxies, in which case the go command will fetch
modules from those proxies. For each request, the go command tries each proxy
in sequence, only moving to the next if the current proxy returns a 404 or 410
HTTP response. The string &#34;direct&#34; may appear in the proxy list,
to cause a direct connection to be attempted at that point in the search.
Any proxies listed after &#34;direct&#34; are never consulted.
</p>
<p>
The GOPRIVATE and GONOPROXY environment variables allow bypassing
the proxy for selected modules. See &#39;go help module-private&#39; for details.
</p>
<p>
No matter the source of the modules, the go command checks downloads against
known checksums, to detect unexpected changes in the content of any specific
module version from one day to the next. This check first consults the current
module&#39;s go.sum file but falls back to the Go checksum database, controlled by
the GOSUMDB and GONOSUMDB environment variables. See &#39;go help module-auth&#39;
for details.
</p>
<p>
See &#39;go help goproxy&#39; for details about the proxy protocol and also
the format of the cached downloaded packages.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Modules_and_vendoring">Modules and vendoring</h3>
<p>
When using modules, the go command typically satisfies dependencies by
downloading modules from their sources and using those downloaded copies
(after verification, as described in the previous section). Vendoring may
be used to allow interoperation with older versions of Go, or to ensure
that all files used for a build are stored together in a single file tree.
</p>
<p>
The command &#39;go mod vendor&#39; constructs a directory named vendor in the main
module&#39;s root directory that contains copies of all packages needed to support
builds and tests of packages in the main module. &#39;go mod vendor&#39; also
creates the file vendor/modules.txt that contains metadata about vendored
packages and module versions. This file should be kept consistent with go.mod:
when vendoring is used, &#39;go mod vendor&#39; should be run after go.mod is updated.
</p>
<p>
If the vendor directory is present in the main module&#39;s root directory, it will
be used automatically if the &#34;go&#34; version in the main module&#39;s go.mod file is
1.14 or higher. Build commands like &#39;go build&#39; and &#39;go test&#39; will load packages
from the vendor directory instead of accessing the network or the local module
cache. To explicitly enable vendoring, invoke the go command with the flag
-mod=vendor. To disable vendoring, use the flag -mod=mod.
</p>
<p>
Unlike vendoring in GOPATH, the go command ignores vendor directories in
locations other than the main module&#39;s root directory.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Module_authentication_using_go_sum">Module authentication using go.sum</h3>
<p>
The go command tries to authenticate every downloaded module,
checking that the bits downloaded for a specific module version today
match bits downloaded yesterday. This ensures repeatable builds
and detects introduction of unexpected changes, malicious or not.
</p>
<p>
In each module&#39;s root, alongside go.mod, the go command maintains
a file named go.sum containing the cryptographic checksums of the
module&#39;s dependencies.
</p>
<p>
The form of each line in go.sum is three fields:
</p>
<pre>&lt;module&gt; &lt;version&gt;[/go.mod] &lt;hash&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Each known module version results in two lines in the go.sum file.
The first line gives the hash of the module version&#39;s file tree.
The second line appends &#34;/go.mod&#34; to the version and gives the hash
of only the module version&#39;s (possibly synthesized) go.mod file.
The go.mod-only hash allows downloading and authenticating a
module version&#39;s go.mod file, which is needed to compute the
dependency graph, without also downloading all the module&#39;s source code.
</p>
<p>
The hash begins with an algorithm prefix of the form &#34;h&lt;N&gt;:&#34;.
The only defined algorithm prefix is &#34;h1:&#34;, which uses SHA-256.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Module_authentication_failures">Module authentication failures</h3>
<p>
The go command maintains a cache of downloaded packages and computes
and records the cryptographic checksum of each package at download time.
In normal operation, the go command checks the main module&#39;s go.sum file
against these precomputed checksums instead of recomputing them on
each command invocation. The &#39;go mod verify&#39; command checks that
the cached copies of module downloads still match both their recorded
checksums and the entries in go.sum.
</p>
<p>
In day-to-day development, the checksum of a given module version
should never change. Each time a dependency is used by a given main
module, the go command checks its local cached copy, freshly
downloaded or not, against the main module&#39;s go.sum. If the checksums
don&#39;t match, the go command reports the mismatch as a security error
and refuses to run the build. When this happens, proceed with caution:
code changing unexpectedly means today&#39;s build will not match
yesterday&#39;s, and the unexpected change may not be beneficial.
</p>
<p>
If the go command reports a mismatch in go.sum, the downloaded code
for the reported module version does not match the one used in a
previous build of the main module. It is important at that point
to find out what the right checksum should be, to decide whether
go.sum is wrong or the downloaded code is wrong. Usually go.sum is right:
you want to use the same code you used yesterday.
</p>
<p>
If a downloaded module is not yet included in go.sum and it is a publicly
available module, the go command consults the Go checksum database to fetch
the expected go.sum lines. If the downloaded code does not match those
lines, the go command reports the mismatch and exits. Note that the
database is not consulted for module versions already listed in go.sum.
</p>
<p>
If a go.sum mismatch is reported, it is always worth investigating why
the code downloaded today differs from what was downloaded yesterday.
</p>
<p>
The GOSUMDB environment variable identifies the name of checksum database
to use and optionally its public key and URL, as in:
</p>
<pre>GOSUMDB=&#34;sum.golang.org&#34;
GOSUMDB=&#34;sum.golang.org+&lt;publickey&gt;&#34;
GOSUMDB=&#34;sum.golang.org+&lt;publickey&gt; <a href="https://sum.golang.org">https://sum.golang.org</a>&#34;
</pre>
<p>
The go command knows the public key of sum.golang.org, and also that the name
sum.golang.google.cn (available inside mainland China) connects to the
sum.golang.org checksum database; use of any other database requires giving
the public key explicitly.
The URL defaults to &#34;https://&#34; followed by the database name.
</p>
<p>
GOSUMDB defaults to &#34;sum.golang.org&#34;, the Go checksum database run by Google.
See <a href="https://sum.golang.org/privacy">https://sum.golang.org/privacy</a> for the service&#39;s privacy policy.
</p>
<p>
If GOSUMDB is set to &#34;off&#34;, or if &#34;go get&#34; is invoked with the -insecure flag,
the checksum database is not consulted, and all unrecognized modules are
accepted, at the cost of giving up the security guarantee of verified repeatable
downloads for all modules. A better way to bypass the checksum database
for specific modules is to use the GOPRIVATE or GONOSUMDB environment
variables. See &#39;go help module-private&#39; for details.
</p>
<p>
The &#39;go env -w&#39; command (see &#39;go help env&#39;) can be used to set these variables
for future go command invocations.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Module_configuration_for_non_public_modules">Module configuration for non-public modules</h3>
<p>
The go command defaults to downloading modules from the public Go module
mirror at proxy.golang.org. It also defaults to validating downloaded modules,
regardless of source, against the public Go checksum database at sum.golang.org.
These defaults work well for publicly available source code.
</p>
<p>
The GOPRIVATE environment variable controls which modules the go command
considers to be private (not available publicly) and should therefore not use the
proxy or checksum database. The variable is a comma-separated list of
glob patterns (in the syntax of Go&#39;s path.Match) of module path prefixes.
For example,
</p>
<pre>GOPRIVATE=*.corp.example.com,rsc.io/private
</pre>
<p>
causes the go command to treat as private any module with a path prefix
matching either pattern, including git.corp.example.com/xyzzy, rsc.io/private,
and rsc.io/private/quux.
</p>
<p>
The GOPRIVATE environment variable may be used by other tools as well to
identify non-public modules. For example, an editor could use GOPRIVATE
to decide whether to hyperlink a package import to a godoc.org page.
</p>
<p>
For fine-grained control over module download and validation, the GONOPROXY
and GONOSUMDB environment variables accept the same kind of glob list
and override GOPRIVATE for the specific decision of whether to use the proxy
and checksum database, respectively.
</p>
<p>
For example, if a company ran a module proxy serving private modules,
users would configure go using:
</p>
<pre>GOPRIVATE=*.corp.example.com
GOPROXY=proxy.example.com
GONOPROXY=none
</pre>
<p>
This would tell the go command and other tools that modules beginning with
a corp.example.com subdomain are private but that the company proxy should
be used for downloading both public and private modules, because
GONOPROXY has been set to a pattern that won&#39;t match any modules,
overriding GOPRIVATE.
</p>
<p>
The &#39;go env -w&#39; command (see &#39;go help env&#39;) can be used to set these variables
for future go command invocations.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Package_lists_and_patterns">Package lists and patterns</h3>
<p>
Many commands apply to a set of packages:
</p>
<pre>go action [packages]
</pre>
<p>
Usually, [packages] is a list of import paths.
</p>
<p>
An import path that is a rooted path or that begins with
a . or .. element is interpreted as a file system path and
denotes the package in that directory.
</p>
<p>
Otherwise, the import path P denotes the package found in
the directory DIR/src/P for some DIR listed in the GOPATH
environment variable (For more details see: &#39;go help gopath&#39;).
</p>
<p>
If no import paths are given, the action applies to the
package in the current directory.
</p>
<p>
There are four reserved names for paths that should not be used
for packages to be built with the go tool:
</p>
<p>
- &#34;main&#34; denotes the top-level package in a stand-alone executable.
</p>
<p>
- &#34;all&#34; expands to all packages found in all the GOPATH
trees. For example, &#39;go list all&#39; lists all the packages on the local
system. When using modules, &#34;all&#34; expands to all packages in
the main module and their dependencies, including dependencies
needed by tests of any of those.
</p>
<p>
- &#34;std&#34; is like all but expands to just the packages in the standard
Go library.
</p>
<p>
- &#34;cmd&#34; expands to the Go repository&#39;s commands and their
internal libraries.
</p>
<p>
Import paths beginning with &#34;cmd/&#34; only match source code in
the Go repository.
</p>
<p>
An import path is a pattern if it includes one or more &#34;...&#34; wildcards,
each of which can match any string, including the empty string and
strings containing slashes. Such a pattern expands to all package
directories found in the GOPATH trees with names matching the
patterns.
</p>
<p>
To make common patterns more convenient, there are two special cases.
First, /... at the end of the pattern can match an empty string,
so that net/... matches both net and packages in its subdirectories, like net/http.
Second, any slash-separated pattern element containing a wildcard never
participates in a match of the &#34;vendor&#34; element in the path of a vendored
package, so that ./... does not match packages in subdirectories of
./vendor or ./mycode/vendor, but ./vendor/... and ./mycode/vendor/... do.
Note, however, that a directory named vendor that itself contains code
is not a vendored package: cmd/vendor would be a command named vendor,
and the pattern cmd/... matches it.
See golang.org/s/go15vendor for more about vendoring.
</p>
<p>
An import path can also name a package to be downloaded from
a remote repository. Run &#39;go help importpath&#39; for details.
</p>
<p>
Every package in a program must have a unique import path.
By convention, this is arranged by starting each path with a
unique prefix that belongs to you. For example, paths used
internally at Google all begin with &#39;google&#39;, and paths
denoting remote repositories begin with the path to the code,
such as &#39;github.com/user/repo&#39;.
</p>
<p>
Packages in a program need not have unique package names,
but there are two reserved package names with special meaning.
The name main indicates a command, not a library.
Commands are built into binaries and cannot be imported.
The name documentation indicates documentation for
a non-Go program in the directory. Files in package documentation
are ignored by the go command.
</p>
<p>
As a special case, if the package list is a list of .go files from a
single directory, the command is applied to a single synthesized
package made up of exactly those files, ignoring any build constraints
in those files and ignoring any other files in the directory.
</p>
<p>
Directory and file names that begin with &#34;.&#34; or &#34;_&#34; are ignored
by the go tool, as are directories named &#34;testdata&#34;.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Testing_flags">Testing flags</h3>
<p>
The &#39;go test&#39; command takes both flags that apply to &#39;go test&#39; itself
and flags that apply to the resulting test binary.
</p>
<p>
Several of the flags control profiling and write an execution profile
suitable for &#34;go tool pprof&#34;; run &#34;go tool pprof -h&#34; for more
information. The --alloc_space, --alloc_objects, and --show_bytes
options of pprof control how the information is presented.
</p>
<p>
The following flags are recognized by the &#39;go test&#39; command and
control the execution of any test:
</p>
<pre>-bench regexp
    Run only those benchmarks matching a regular expression.
    By default, no benchmarks are run.
    To run all benchmarks, use &#39;-bench .&#39; or &#39;-bench=.&#39;.
    The regular expression is split by unbracketed slash (/)
    characters into a sequence of regular expressions, and each
    part of a benchmark&#39;s identifier must match the corresponding
    element in the sequence, if any. Possible parents of matches
    are run with b.N=1 to identify sub-benchmarks. For example,
    given -bench=X/Y, top-level benchmarks matching X are run
    with b.N=1 to find any sub-benchmarks matching Y, which are
    then run in full.

-benchtime t
    Run enough iterations of each benchmark to take t, specified
    as a time.Duration (for example, -benchtime 1h30s).
    The default is 1 second (1s).
    The special syntax Nx means to run the benchmark N times
    (for example, -benchtime 100x).

-count n
    Run each test and benchmark n times (default 1).
    If -cpu is set, run n times for each GOMAXPROCS value.
    Examples are always run once.

-cover
    Enable coverage analysis.
    Note that because coverage works by annotating the source
    code before compilation, compilation and test failures with
    coverage enabled may report line numbers that don&#39;t correspond
    to the original sources.

-covermode set,count,atomic
    Set the mode for coverage analysis for the package[s]
    being tested. The default is &#34;set&#34; unless -race is enabled,
    in which case it is &#34;atomic&#34;.
    The values:
	set: bool: does this statement run?
	count: int: how many times does this statement run?
	atomic: int: count, but correct in multithreaded tests;
		significantly more expensive.
    Sets -cover.

-coverpkg pattern1,pattern2,pattern3
    Apply coverage analysis in each test to packages matching the patterns.
    The default is for each test to analyze only the package being tested.
    See &#39;go help packages&#39; for a description of package patterns.
    Sets -cover.

-cpu 1,2,4
    Specify a list of GOMAXPROCS values for which the tests or
    benchmarks should be executed. The default is the current value
    of GOMAXPROCS.

-failfast
    Do not start new tests after the first test failure.

-list regexp
    List tests, benchmarks, or examples matching the regular expression.
    No tests, benchmarks or examples will be run. This will only
    list top-level tests. No subtest or subbenchmarks will be shown.

-parallel n
    Allow parallel execution of test functions that call t.Parallel.
    The value of this flag is the maximum number of tests to run
    simultaneously; by default, it is set to the value of GOMAXPROCS.
    Note that -parallel only applies within a single test binary.
    The &#39;go test&#39; command may run tests for different packages
    in parallel as well, according to the setting of the -p flag
    (see &#39;go help build&#39;).

-run regexp
    Run only those tests and examples matching the regular expression.
    For tests, the regular expression is split by unbracketed slash (/)
    characters into a sequence of regular expressions, and each part
    of a test&#39;s identifier must match the corresponding element in
    the sequence, if any. Note that possible parents of matches are
    run too, so that -run=X/Y matches and runs and reports the result
    of all tests matching X, even those without sub-tests matching Y,
    because it must run them to look for those sub-tests.

-short
    Tell long-running tests to shorten their run time.
    It is off by default but set during all.bash so that installing
    the Go tree can run a sanity check but not spend time running
    exhaustive tests.

-timeout d
    If a test binary runs longer than duration d, panic.
    If d is 0, the timeout is disabled.
    The default is 10 minutes (10m).

-v
    Verbose output: log all tests as they are run. Also print all
    text from Log and Logf calls even if the test succeeds.

-vet list
    Configure the invocation of &#34;go vet&#34; during &#34;go test&#34;
    to use the comma-separated list of vet checks.
    If list is empty, &#34;go test&#34; runs &#34;go vet&#34; with a curated list of
    checks believed to be always worth addressing.
    If list is &#34;off&#34;, &#34;go test&#34; does not run &#34;go vet&#34; at all.
</pre>
<p>
The following flags are also recognized by &#39;go test&#39; and can be used to
profile the tests during execution:
</p>
<pre>-benchmem
    Print memory allocation statistics for benchmarks.

-blockprofile block.out
    Write a goroutine blocking profile to the specified file
    when all tests are complete.
    Writes test binary as -c would.

-blockprofilerate n
    Control the detail provided in goroutine blocking profiles by
    calling runtime.SetBlockProfileRate with n.
    See &#39;go doc runtime.SetBlockProfileRate&#39;.
    The profiler aims to sample, on average, one blocking event every
    n nanoseconds the program spends blocked. By default,
    if -test.blockprofile is set without this flag, all blocking events
    are recorded, equivalent to -test.blockprofilerate=1.

-coverprofile cover.out
    Write a coverage profile to the file after all tests have passed.
    Sets -cover.

-cpuprofile cpu.out
    Write a CPU profile to the specified file before exiting.
    Writes test binary as -c would.

-memprofile mem.out
    Write an allocation profile to the file after all tests have passed.
    Writes test binary as -c would.

-memprofilerate n
    Enable more precise (and expensive) memory allocation profiles by
    setting runtime.MemProfileRate. See &#39;go doc runtime.MemProfileRate&#39;.
    To profile all memory allocations, use -test.memprofilerate=1.

-mutexprofile mutex.out
    Write a mutex contention profile to the specified file
    when all tests are complete.
    Writes test binary as -c would.

-mutexprofilefraction n
    Sample 1 in n stack traces of goroutines holding a
    contended mutex.

-outputdir directory
    Place output files from profiling in the specified directory,
    by default the directory in which &#34;go test&#34; is running.

-trace trace.out
    Write an execution trace to the specified file before exiting.
</pre>
<p>
Each of these flags is also recognized with an optional &#39;test.&#39; prefix,
as in -test.v. When invoking the generated test binary (the result of
&#39;go test -c&#39;) directly, however, the prefix is mandatory.
</p>
<p>
The &#39;go test&#39; command rewrites or removes recognized flags,
as appropriate, both before and after the optional package list,
before invoking the test binary.
</p>
<p>
For instance, the command
</p>
<pre>go test -v -myflag testdata -cpuprofile=prof.out -x
</pre>
<p>
will compile the test binary and then run it as
</p>
<pre>pkg.test -test.v -myflag testdata -test.cpuprofile=prof.out
</pre>
<p>
(The -x flag is removed because it applies only to the go command&#39;s
execution, not to the test itself.)
</p>
<p>
The test flags that generate profiles (other than for coverage) also
leave the test binary in pkg.test for use when analyzing the profiles.
</p>
<p>
When &#39;go test&#39; runs a test binary, it does so from within the
corresponding package&#39;s source code directory. Depending on the test,
it may be necessary to do the same when invoking a generated test
binary directly.
</p>
<p>
The command-line package list, if present, must appear before any
flag not known to the go test command. Continuing the example above,
the package list would have to appear before -myflag, but could appear
on either side of -v.
</p>
<p>
When &#39;go test&#39; runs in package list mode, &#39;go test&#39; caches successful
package test results to avoid unnecessary repeated running of tests. To
disable test caching, use any test flag or argument other than the
cacheable flags. The idiomatic way to disable test caching explicitly
is to use -count=1.
</p>
<p>
To keep an argument for a test binary from being interpreted as a
known flag or a package name, use -args (see &#39;go help test&#39;) which
passes the remainder of the command line through to the test binary
uninterpreted and unaltered.
</p>
<p>
For instance, the command
</p>
<pre>go test -v -args -x -v
</pre>
<p>
will compile the test binary and then run it as
</p>
<pre>pkg.test -test.v -x -v
</pre>
<p>
Similarly,
</p>
<pre>go test -args math
</pre>
<p>
will compile the test binary and then run it as
</p>
<pre>pkg.test math
</pre>
<p>
In the first example, the -x and the second -v are passed through to the
test binary unchanged and with no effect on the go command itself.
In the second example, the argument math is passed through to the test
binary, instead of being interpreted as the package list.
</p>
<h3 id="hdr-Testing_functions">Testing functions</h3>
<p>
The &#39;go test&#39; command expects to find test, benchmark, and example functions
in the &#34;*_test.go&#34; files corresponding to the package under test.
</p>
<p>
A test function is one named TestXxx (where Xxx does not start with a
lower case letter) and should have the signature,
</p>
<pre>func TestXxx(t *testing.T) { ... }
</pre>
<p>
A benchmark function is one named BenchmarkXxx and should have the signature,
</p>
<pre>func BenchmarkXxx(b *testing.B) { ... }
</pre>
<p>
An example function is similar to a test function but, instead of using
*testing.T to report success or failure, prints output to os.Stdout.
If the last comment in the function starts with &#34;Output:&#34; then the output
is compared exactly against the comment (see examples below). If the last
comment begins with &#34;Unordered output:&#34; then the output is compared to the
comment, however the order of the lines is ignored. An example with no such
comment is compiled but not executed. An example with no text after
&#34;Output:&#34; is compiled, executed, and expected to produce no output.
</p>
<p>
Godoc displays the body of ExampleXxx to demonstrate the use
of the function, constant, or variable Xxx. An example of a method M with
receiver type T or *T is named ExampleT_M. There may be multiple examples
for a given function, constant, or variable, distinguished by a trailing _xxx,
where xxx is a suffix not beginning with an upper case letter.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of an example:
</p>
<pre>func ExamplePrintln() {
	Println(&#34;The output of\nthis example.&#34;)
	// Output: The output of
	// this example.
}
</pre>
<p>
Here is another example where the ordering of the output is ignored:
</p>
<pre>func ExamplePerm() {
	for _, value := range Perm(4) {
		fmt.Println(value)
	}

	// Unordered output: 4
	// 2
	// 1
	// 3
	// 0
}
</pre>
<p>
The entire test file is presented as the example when it contains a single
example function, at least one other function, type, variable, or constant
declaration, and no test or benchmark functions.
</p>
<p>
See the documentation of the testing package for more information.
